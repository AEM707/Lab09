His parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people\u2014his imagination had never really acc", "45": "epted them as his parents at all. The truth was that Jay Gatsby of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic conception of", "46": " himself.

But his heart was in a constant, turbulent ri", "53": "ot. The most grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night. A universe of ineffable gaudiness spun itself out", "54": " in his brain while the clock ticked on the washstand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled clothes upon the floor. Eac", "55": "h night he added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace.

An instinct toward his future glory had led him, some mo", "58": "nths before, to the small Lutheran College of St. Olaf\u2019s in southern Minnesota. He stayed there two weeks, dismayed at its feroc", "59": "ious indifference to the drums of his destiny, to destiny itself, and despising the janitor\u2019s work with which he was to pay his ", "60": "way through. Then he drifted back to Lake Superior, and he was still searching for something to do on the day that Dan Cody\u2019s ya", "61": "cht dropped anchor in the shallows alongshore. Cody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada silver fields, of the Yuko", "62": "n, of every rush for metal since seventyfive.

To young Gatz, resting on his oa", "3": "rs and looking up at the railed deck, that yacht represented all the beauty and glamour in the world. I suppose he smiled at Cod", "4": "y\u2014he had probably discovered that people liked him when he smiled.

It was indirectly due to Cody that Gatsby drank so little. Sometim", "14": "es in the course of gay parties women used to rub champagne into his hair; for himself he formed the habit of letting liquor alo", "15": "ne. And it was from Cody that he inherited money\u2014a legacy of twentyfive thousand dollars. He didn\u2019t get it. He never understood ", "16": "the legal device that was used against him, but what remained of the millions went intact to Ella Kaye.

So I take advantage of this short halt, while Gatsby, so to speak, caught his breath, to clear this set o", "21": "f misconceptions away. It was a halt, too, in my association with his affairs.
