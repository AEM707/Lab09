His parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people\u2014his imagination had never really acc", "45": "epted them as his parents at all. The truth was that Jay Gatsby of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic conception of", "46": " himself.

Eac", "55": "h night he added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace.

An instinct toward his future glory had led him, some mo", "58": "nths before, to the small Lutheran College of St. Olaf\u2019s in southern Minnesota. He stayed there two weeks, dismayed at its feroc", "59": "ious indifference to the drums of his destiny, to destiny itself, and despising the janitor\u2019s work with which he was to pay his ", "60": "way through. Then he drifted back to Lake Superior, and he was still searching for something to do on the day that Dan Cody\u2019s ya", "61": "cht dropped anchor in the shallows alongshore.

To young Gatz, resting on his oa", "3": "rs and looking up at the railed deck, that yacht represented all the beauty and glamour in the world. I suppose he smiled at Cod", "4": "y\u2014he had probably discovered that people liked him when he smiled.

It was indirectly due to Cody that Gatsby drank so little. Sometim", "14": "es in the course of gay parties women used to rub champagne into his hair; for himself he formed the habit of letting liquor alo", "15": "ne. And it was from Cody that he inherited money\u2014a legacy of twentyfive thousand dollars. He didn\u2019t get it. He never understood ", "16": "the legal device that was used against him, but what remained of the millions went intact to Ella Kaye.

The Widow Douglas she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was ", "14": "rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I c", "15": "ouldn\u2019t stand it no longer I lit out. I got into my old rags and my sugarhogshead again, and was free and satisfied. But Tom Saw", "16": "yer he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I would go back to the widow and be re", "17": "spectable. So I went back. The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she called me a lot of other names, ", "18": "too, but she never meant no harm by it. She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn\u2019t do nothing but sweat and sweat, and", "19": " feel all cramped up. Well, then, the old thing commenced again. The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come to time. ", "20": "When you got to the table you couldn\u2019t go right to eating, but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a", "21": " little over the victuals, though there warn\u2019t really anything the matter with them,\u2014that is, nothing only everything was cooked", "22": " by itself. In a barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the juice kind of swaps around, and the thing", "23": "s go better. After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out a", "24": "ll about him; but byandby she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so then I didn\u2019t care no more about ", "25": "him, because I don\u2019t take no stock in dead people. Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me. But she wouldn\u2019", "26": "t. She said it was a mean practice and wasn\u2019t clean, and I must try to not do it any more. That is just the way with some people", "27": ". They get down on a thing when they don\u2019t know nothing about it. Here she was abothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, ", "28": "and no use to anybody, being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a thing that had some good in it. And", "29": " she took snuff, too; of course that was all right, because she done it herself. Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old m", "30": "aid, with goggles on, had just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a spellingbook. She worked me middling hard ", "31": "for about an hour, and then the widow made her ease up. I couldn\u2019t stood it much longer. Then for an hour it was deadly dull, an", "32": "d I was fidgety. Miss Watson would say, \u201cDon\u2019t put your feet up there, Huckleberry;\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t scrunch up like that, Huckleberr", "33": "y\u2014set up straight;\u201d and pretty soon she would say, \u201cDon\u2019t gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry\u2014why don\u2019t you try to behave?\u201d T", "34": "hen she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished I was there. She got mad then, but I didn\u2019t mean no harm. All I wan", "35": "ted was to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn\u2019t particular. She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wo", "36": "uldn\u2019t say it for the whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place. Well, I couldn\u2019t see no advantage in goi", "37": "ng where she was going, so I made up my mind I wouldn\u2019t try for it. But I never said so, because it would only make trouble, and", "38": " wouldn\u2019t do no good. Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good place. She said all a body would h", "39": "ave to do there was to go around all day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever. So I didn\u2019t think much of it. But I never ", "40": "said so. I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer would go there, and she said not by a considerable sight. I was glad about that,", "41": " because I wanted him and me to be together. Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome. Byandby they ", "42": "fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then everybody was off to bed. I went up to my room with a piece of candle, and put ", "43": "it on the table. Then I set down in a chair by the window and tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn\u2019t no use. I felt", "44": " so lonesome I most wished I was dead. The stars were shining, and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard", "45": " an owl, away off, whowhooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to d", "46": "ie; and the wind was trying to whisper something to me, and I couldn\u2019t make out what it was, and so it made the cold shivers run", "47": " over me. Then away out in the woods I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something that\u2019", "48": "s on its mind and can\u2019t make itself understood, and so can\u2019t rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night gr", "49": "ieving. I got so downhearted and scared I did wish I had some company. Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I ", "50": "flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it was all shriveled up. I didn\u2019t need anybody to tell me that", "51": " that was an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared and most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and", "52": " turned around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied up a little lock of my hair with a thr", "53": "ead to keep witches away. But I hadn\u2019t no confidence. You do that when you\u2019ve lost a horseshoe that you\u2019ve found, instead of nai", "54": "ling it up over the door, but I hadn\u2019t ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you\u2019d killed a spider. I ", "55": "set down again, ashaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke; for the house was all as still as death now, and so the wido", "56": "w wouldn\u2019t know. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town go boom\u2014boom\u2014boom\u2014twelve licks; and all still ag", "57": "ain\u2014stiller than ever. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees\u2014something was a stirring. I set still ", "58": "and listened. Directly I could just barely hear a \u201c_meyow! meyow!_\u201d down there. That was good! Says I, \u201c_meyow! meyow!_\u201d as soft", "59": " as I could, and then I put out the light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed. Then I slipped down to the ground and ", "60": "crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough, there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me. CHAPTER II. We went tiptoeing along a path am", "61": "ongst the trees back towards the end of the widow\u2019s garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn\u2019t scrape our heads. When we ", "62": "was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made a noise. We scrouched down and laid still. Miss Watson\u2019s big nigger, name", "63": "d Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him pretty clear, because there was a light behind him. He got up and stret", "64": "ched his neck out about a minute, listening. Then he says: \u201cWho dah?\u201d He listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and sto"}, "38": {"1": "od right between us; we could a touched him, nearly. Well, likely it was minutes and minutes that there warn\u2019t a sound, and we a", "2": "ll there so close together. There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I dasn\u2019t scratch it; and then my ear begun to", "3": " itch; and next my back, right between my shoulders. Seemed like I\u2019d die if I couldn\u2019t scratch. Well, I\u2019ve noticed that thing pl", "4": "enty times since. If you are with the quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain\u2019t sleepy\u2014if you are anywhe", "5": "res where it won\u2019t do for you to scratch, why you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places. Pretty soon Jim says: \u201cSay", "6": ", who is you? Whar is you? Dog my cats ef I didn\u2019 hear sumf\u2019n. Well, I know what I\u2019s gwyne to do: I\u2019s gwyne to set down here and", "7": " listen tell I hears it agin.\u201d So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom. He leaned his back up against a tree, and stretc", "8": "hed his legs out till one of them most touched one of mine. My nose begun to itch. It itched till the tears come into my eyes. B", "9": "ut I dasn\u2019t scratch. Then it begun to itch on the inside. Next I got to itching underneath. I didn\u2019t know how I was going to set", "10": " still. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; but it seemed a sight longer than that. I was itching in ele", "11": "ven different places now. I reckoned I couldn\u2019t stand it more\u2019n a minute longer, but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try. J", "12": "ust then Jim begun to breathe heavy; next he begun to snore\u2014and then I was pretty soon comfortable again. Tom he made a sign to ", "13": "me\u2014kind of a little noise with his mouth\u2014and we went creeping away on our hands and knees. When we was ten foot off Tom whispere", "14": "d to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun. But I said no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they\u2019d find ou", "15": "t I warn\u2019t in. Then Tom said he hadn\u2019t got candles enough, and he would slip in the kitchen and get some more. I didn\u2019t want him", "16": " to try. I said Jim might wake up and come. But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there and got three candles, and Tom laid f", "17": "ive cents on the table for pay. Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing would do Tom but he must crawl to", "18": " where Jim was, on his hands and knees, and play something on him. I waited, and it seemed a good while, everything was so still", "19": " and lonesome. As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence, and byandby fetched up on the steep top o", "20": "f the hill the other side of the house. Tom said he slipped Jim\u2019s hat off of his head and hung it on a limb right over him, and ", "21": "Jim stirred a little, but he didn\u2019t wake. Afterwards Jim said the witches bewitched him and put him in a trance, and rode him al", "22": "l over the State, and then set him under the trees again, and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it. And next time Jim told", "23": " it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that, every time he told it he spread it more and more, till byandby h", "24": "e said they rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his back was all over saddleboils. Jim was monstrous p", "25": "roud about it, and he got so he wouldn\u2019t hardly notice the other niggers. Niggers would come miles to hear Jim tell about it, an", "26": "d he was more looked up to than any nigger in that country. Strange niggers would stand with their mouths open and look him all ", "27": "over, same as if he was a wonder. Niggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but whenever one was ", "28": "talking and letting on to know all about such things, Jim would happen in and say, \u201cHm! What you know \u2019bout witches?\u201d and that n", "29": "igger was corked up and had to take a back seat. Jim always kept that fivecenter piece round his neck with a string, and said it", "30": " was a charm the devil give to him with his own hands, and told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he ", "31": "wanted to just by saying something to it; but he never told what it was he said to it. Niggers would come from all around there ", "32": "and give Jim anything they had, just for a sight of that fivecenter piece; but they wouldn\u2019t touch it, because the devil had had", "33": " his hands on it. Jim was most ruined for a servant, because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil and been rode b", "34": "y witches. Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down into the village and could see three or four", "35": " lights twinkling, where there was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever so fine; and down by the village ", "36": "was the river, a whole mile broad, and awful still and grand. We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and Ben Rogers, and two ", "37": "or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard. So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half, to the", "38": " big scar on the hillside, and went ashore. We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the secret, and t", "39": "hen showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest part of the bushes. Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our han", "40": "ds and knees. We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave opened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soo", "41": "n ducked under a wall where you wouldn\u2019t a noticed that there was a hole. We went along a narrow place and got into a kind of ro", "42": "om, all damp and sweaty and cold, and there we stopped. Tom says: \u201cNow, we\u2019ll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer\u2019", "43": "s Gang. Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his name in blood.\u201d Everybody was willing. So Tom got ou", "44": "t a sheet of paper that he had wrote the oath on, and read it. It swore every boy to stick to the band, and never tell any of th", "45": "e secrets; and if anybody done anything to any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his family mus", "46": "t do it, and he mustn\u2019t eat and he mustn\u2019t sleep till he had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign", "47": " of the band. And nobody that didn\u2019t belong to the band could use that mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it ag", "48": "ain he must be killed. And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he must have his throat cut, and then have his", "49": " carcass burnt up and the ashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list with blood and never mentioned again ", "50": "by the gang, but have a curse put on it and be forgot forever. Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he ", "51": "got it out of his own head. He said, some of it, but the rest was out of piratebooks and robberbooks, and every gang that was hi", "52": "ghtoned had it. Some thought it would be good to kill the _families_ of boys that told the secrets. Tom said it was a good idea,", "53": " so he took a pencil and wrote it in. Then Ben Rogers says: \u201cHere\u2019s Huck Finn, he hain\u2019t got no family; what you going to do \u2019bo", "54": "ut him?\u201d \u201cWell, hain\u2019t he got a father?\u201d says Tom Sawyer. \u201cYes, he\u2019s got a father, but you can\u2019t never find him these days. He u", "55": "sed to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he hain\u2019t been seen in these parts for a year or more.\u201d They talked it over, ", "56": "and they was going to rule me out, because they said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it wouldn\u2019t be fa", "57": "ir and square for the others. Well, nobody could think of anything to do\u2014everybody was stumped, and set still. I was most ready ", "58": "to cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered them Miss Watson\u2014they could kill her. Everybody said: \u201cOh, she\u2019ll d", "59": "o. That\u2019s all right. Huck can come in.\u201d Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with, and I made my mark", "60": " on the paper. \u201cNow,\u201d says Ben Rogers, \u201cwhat\u2019s the line of business of this Gang?\u201d \u201cNothing only robbery and murder,\u201d Tom said. ", "61": "\u201cBut who are we going to rob?\u2014houses, or cattle, or\u2014\u201d \u201cStuff! stealing cattle and such things ain\u2019t robbery; it\u2019s burglary,\u201d say", "62": "s Tom Sawyer. \u201cWe ain\u2019t burglars. That ain\u2019t no sort of style. We are highwaymen. We stop stages and carriages on the road, with", "63": " masks on, and kill the people and take their watches and money.\u201d \u201cMust we always kill the people?\u201d \u201cOh, certainly. It\u2019s best.

So somebody\u2019s got to set up all night a", "10": "nd never get any sleep, just so as to watch them. I think that\u2019s foolishness.

But go ahead, I ain\u2019t got nothing to say.\u201d Little Tommy Barnes was", "19": " asleep now, and when they waked him up he was scared, and cried, and said he wanted to go home to his ma, and didn\u2019t want to be", "20": " a robber any more. So they all made fun of him, and called him crybaby, and that made him mad, and he said he would go straight", "21": " and tell all the secrets. But Tom give him five cents to keep quiet, and said we would all go home and meet next week, and rob ", "22": "somebody and kill some people. Ben Rogers said he couldn\u2019t get out much, only Sundays, and so he wanted to begin next Sunday; bu", "23": "t all the boys said it would be wicked to do it on Sunday, and that settled the thing. They agreed to get together and fix a day", "24": " as soon as they could, and then we elected Tom Sawyer first captain and Jo Harper second captain of the Gang, and so started ho", "25": "me. I clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was breaking. My new clothes was all greased up and clayey, and", "26": " I was dogtired. CHAPTER III. Well, I got a good goingover in the morning from old Miss Watson on account of my clothes; but the", "27": " widow she didn\u2019t scold, but only cleaned off the grease and clay, and looked so sorry that I thought I would behave a while if ", "28": "I could. Then Miss Watson she took me in the closet and prayed, but nothing come of it. She told me to pray every day, and whate", "29": "ver I asked for I would get it. But it warn\u2019t so. I tried it. Once I got a fishline, but no hooks. It warn\u2019t any good to me with", "30": "out hooks. I tried for the hooks three or four times, but somehow I couldn\u2019t make it work. Byandby, one day, I asked Miss Watson", "31": " to try for me, but she said I was a fool. She never told me why, and I couldn\u2019t make it out no way. I set down one time back in", "32": " the woods, and had a long think about it. I says to myself, if a body can get anything they pray for, why don\u2019t Deacon Winn get", "33": " back the money he lost on pork? Why can\u2019t the widow get back her silver snuffbox that was stole? Why can\u2019t Miss Watson fat up? ", "34": "No, says I to myself, there ain\u2019t nothing in it. I went and told the widow about it, and she said the thing a body could get by ", "35": "praying for it was \u201cspiritual gifts.\u201d This was too many for me, but she told me what she meant\u2014I must help other people, and do ", "36": "everything I could for other people, and look out for them all the time, and never think about myself. This was including Miss W", "37": "atson, as I took it. I went out in the woods and turned it over in my mind a long time, but I couldn\u2019t see no advantage about it", "38": "\u2014except for the other people; so at last I reckoned I wouldn\u2019t worry about it any more, but just let it go. Sometimes the widow ", "39": "would take me one side and talk about Providence in a way to make a body\u2019s mouth water; but maybe next day Miss Watson would tak", "40": "e hold and knock it all down again. I judged I could see that there was two Providences, and a poor chap would stand considerabl", "41": "e show with the widow\u2019s Providence, but if Miss Watson\u2019s got him there warn\u2019t no help for him any more. I thought it all out, an", "42": "d reckoned I would belong to the widow\u2019s if he wanted me, though I couldn\u2019t make out how he was agoing to be any better off then", "43": " than what he was before, seeing I was so ignorant, and so kind of lowdown and ornery.

He used to always whale me when he was sober and could g", "45": "et his hands on me; though I used to take to the woods most of the time when he was around. Well, about this time he was found i", "46": "n the river drownded, about twelve mile above town, so people said. They judged it was him, anyway; said this drownded man was j", "47": "ust his size, and was ragged, and had uncommon long hair, which was all like pap; but they couldn\u2019t make nothing out of the face", "48": ", because it had been in the water so long it warn\u2019t much like a face at all. They said he was floating on his back in the water", "49": ". They took him and buried him on the bank. But I warn\u2019t comfortable long, because I happened to think of something. I knowed mi", "50": "ghty well that a drownded man don\u2019t float on his back, but on his face. So I knowed, then, that this warn\u2019t pap, but a woman dre", "51": "ssed up in a man\u2019s clothes. So I was uncomfortable again. I judged the old man would turn up again byandby, though I wished he w", "52": "ouldn\u2019t. We played robber now and then about a month, and then I resigned. All the boys did.

It was pretty good times up in", "38": " the woods there, take it all around. But byandby pap got too handy with his hick\u2019ry, and I couldn\u2019t stand it. I was all over we", "39": "lts.

I judged he had got drownded, and I wasn\u2019t ever going to get out any more. I was scared. I made up my mind I would fix up som", "41": "e way to leave there. I had tried to get out of that cabin many a time, but I couldn\u2019t find no way. There warn\u2019t a window to it ", "42": "big enough for a dog to get through. I couldn\u2019t get up the chimbly; it was too narrow. The door was thick, solid oak slabs.

But this time I f", "45": "ound something at last; I found an old rusty woodsaw without any handle; it was laid in between a rafter and the clapboards of t", "46": "he roof. I greased it up and went to work. There was an old horseblanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin beh", "47": "ind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and putting the candle out. I got under the table and raised the", "48": " blanket, and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out\u2014big enough to let me through.

I got rid of the signs of my work, and dropped th", "50": "e blanket and hid my saw, and pretty soon pap come in. Pap warn\u2019t in a good humor\u2014so he was his natural self. He said he was dow", "51": "n town, and everything was going wrong. His lawyer said he reckoned he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got ", "52": "started on the trial; but then there was ways to put it off a long time, and Judge Thatcher knowed how to do it. And he said peo", "53": "ple allowed there\u2019d be another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my guardian, and they guessed it would", "54": " win this time. This shook me up considerable, because I didn\u2019t want to go back to the widow\u2019s any more and be so cramped up and", "55": " sivilized, as they called it. Then the old man got to cussing, and cussed everything and everybody he could think of, and then ", "56": "cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn\u2019t skipped any, and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all ", "57": "round, including a considerable parcel of people which he didn\u2019t know the names of, and so called them what\u2019shisname when he got", "58": " to them, and went right along with his cussing.

That made me pretty uneasy again, but only for a minute; I reckoned I wouldn\u2019t stay on h", "61": "and till he got that chance. The old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had got. There was a fiftypound sack of", "62": " corn meal, and a side of bacon, ammunition, and a fourgallon jug of whisky, and an old book and two newspapers for wadding, bes", "63": "ides some tow.

Well, all at once here comes a canoe; just a beauty, too, about thirteen or fourteen foot long, riding high like a duck", "13": ". I shot headfirst off of the bank like a frog, clothes and all on, and struck out for the canoe. I just expected there\u2019d be som", "14": "ebody laying down in it, because people often done that to fool folks, and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they\u2019d ", "15": "raise up and laugh at him.

It was pretty close to the shanty, and I thought I heard the o", "20": "ld man coming all the time; but I got her hid; and then I out and looked around a bunch of willows, and there was the old man do", "21": "wn the path a piece just drawing a bead on a bird with his gun. So he hadn\u2019t seen anything. When he got along I was hard at it t", "22": "aking up a \u201ctrot\u201d line. He abused me a little for being so slow; but I told him I fell in the river, and that was what made me s", "23": "o long. I knowed he would see I was wet, and then he would be asking questions. We got five catfish off the lines and went home.", "24": " While we laid off after breakfast to sleep up, both of us being about wore out, I got to thinking that if I could fix up some w", "25": "ay to keep pap and the widow from trying to follow me, it would be a certainer thing than trusting to luck to get far enough off", "26": " before they missed me; you see, all kinds of things might happen. Well, I didn\u2019t see no way for a while, but byandby pap raised", "27": " up a minute to drink another barrel of water, and he says: \u201cAnother time a man comes aprowling round here you roust me out, you", "28": " hear? That man warn\u2019t here for no good. I\u2019d a shot him. Next time you roust me out, you hear?\u201d Then he dropped down and went to", "29": " sleep again; but what he had been saying give me the very idea I wanted. I says to myself, I can fix it now so nobody won\u2019t thi", "30": "nk of following me. About twelve o\u2019clock we turned out and went along up the bank. The river was coming up pretty fast, and lots", "31": " of driftwood going by on the rise. Byandby along comes part of a log raft\u2014nine logs fast together. We went out with the skiff a", "32": "nd towed it ashore. Then we had dinner. Anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through, so as to catch more stuff; but ", "33": "that warn\u2019t pap\u2019s style. Nine logs was enough for one time; he must shove right over to town and sell. So he locked me in and to", "34": "ok the skiff, and started off towing the raft about halfpast three. I judged he wouldn\u2019t come back that night. I waited till I r", "35": "eckoned he had got a good start; then I out with my saw, and went to work on that log again. Before he was t\u2019other side of the r", "36": "iver I was out of the hole; him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder. I took the sack of corn meal and too", "37": "k it to where the canoe was hid, and shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in; then I done the same with the side of ba", "38": "con; then the whiskyjug. I took all the coffee and sugar there was, and all the ammunition; I took the wadding; I took the bucke", "39": "t and gourd; I took a dipper and a tin cup, and my old saw and two blankets, and the skillet and the coffeepot. I took fishlines", "40": " and matches and other things\u2014everything that was worth a cent. I cleaned out the place. I wanted an axe, but there wasn\u2019t any, ", "41": "only the one out at the woodpile, and I knowed why I was going to leave that. I fetched out the gun, and now I was done. I had w", "42": "ore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging out so many things. So I fixed that as good as I could from the", "43": " outside by scattering dust on the place, which covered up the smoothness and the sawdust. Then I fixed the piece of log back in", "44": "to its place, and put two rocks under it and one against it to hold it there, for it was bent up at that place and didn\u2019t quite ", "45": "touch ground. If you stood four or five foot away and didn\u2019t know it was sawed, you wouldn\u2019t never notice it; and besides, this ", "46": "was the back of the cabin, and it warn\u2019t likely anybody would go fooling around there. It was all grass clear to the canoe, so I", "47": " hadn\u2019t left a track. I followed around to see. I stood on the bank and looked out over the river. All safe. So I took the gun a", "48": "nd went up a piece into the woods, and was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig; hogs soon went wild in them bott", "49": "oms after they had got away from the prairie farms. I shot this fellow and took him into camp. I took the axe and smashed in the", "50": " door. I beat it and hacked it considerable adoing it. I fetched the pig in, and took him back nearly to the table and hacked in", "51": "to his throat with the axe, and laid him down on the ground to bleed; I say ground because it _was_ ground\u2014hard packed, and no b", "52": "oards. Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks in it\u2014all I could drag\u2014and I started it from the pig, and dragge", "53": "d it to the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in, and down it sunk, out of sight. You could easy see th", "54": "at something had been dragged over the ground. I did wish Tom Sawyer was there; I knowed he would take an interest in this kind ", "55": "of business, and throw in the fancy touches. Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as that. Well, last I p", "56": "ulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe good, and stuck it on the back side, and slung the axe in the corner. Then I took", "57": " up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn\u2019t drip) till I got a good piece below the house and then dump", "58": "ed him into the river. Now I thought of something else. So I went and got the bag of meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and f", "59": "etched them to the house. I took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in the bottom of it with the saw, for ther", "60": "e warn\u2019t no knives and forks on the place\u2014pap done everything with his claspknife about the cooking. Then I carried the sack abo", "61": "ut a hundred yards across the grass and through the willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile wide and ful", "62": "l of rushes\u2014and ducks too, you might say, in the season.

When I woke up I didn\u2019t know where I was for a minute. I set up and looked", "10": " around, a little scared. Then I remembered. The river looked miles and miles across. The moon was so bright I could a counted t", "11": "he drift logs that went aslipping along, black and still, hundreds of yards out from shore. Everything was dead quiet, and it lo", "12": "oked late, and _smelt_ late. You know what I mean\u2014I don\u2019t know the words to put it in. I took a good gap and a stretch, and was ", "13": "just going to unhitch and start when I heard a sound away over the water. I listened. Pretty soon I made it out. It was that dul", "14": "l kind of a regular sound that comes from oars working in rowlocks when it\u2019s a still night. I peeped out through the willow bran", "15": "ches, and there it was\u2014a skiff, away across the water. I couldn\u2019t tell how many was in it. It kept acoming, and when it was abre", "16": "ast of me I see there warn\u2019t but one man in it. Think\u2019s I, maybe it\u2019s pap, though I warn\u2019t expecting him.

Well, it _was_ pap, sure enough\u2014and sober, too, by the way he laid his oars. I didn\u2019t lose no time. The next mi", "19": "nute I was aspinning down stream soft but quick in the shade of the bank. I made two mile and a half, and then struck out a quar", "20": "ter of a mile or more towards the middle of the river, because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing, and people migh", "21": "t see me and hail me. I got out amongst the driftwood, and then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float.

T\u2019other one said _this_ warn\u2019t one of the short ones, he reckoned\u2014and then they laughed, ", "26": "and he said it over again, and they laughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told him, and laughed, but he didn\u2019t la", "27": "ugh; he ripped out something brisk, and said let him alone.

After that the talk got further and furt", "30": "her away, and I couldn\u2019t make out the words any more; but I could hear the mumble, and now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed ", "31": "a long ways off. I was away below the ferry now. I rose up, and there was Jackson\u2019s Island, about two mile and a half down strea", "32": "m, heavy timbered and standing up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid, like a steamboat without any lights. T", "33": "here warn\u2019t any signs of the bar at the head\u2014it was all under water now. It didn\u2019t take me long to get there. I shot past the he", "34": "ad at a ripping rate, the current was so swift, and then I got into the dead water and landed on the side towards the Illinois s", "35": "hore. I run the canoe into a deep dent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willow branches to get in; and when I ", "36": "made fast nobody could a seen the canoe from the outside. I went up and set down on a log at the head of the island, and looked ", "37": "out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town, three mile away, where there was three or four lights tw", "38": "inkling. A monstrous big lumberraft was about a mile up stream, coming along down, with a lantern in the middle of it. I watched", "39": " it come creeping down, and when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say, \u201cStern oars, there! heave her head to s", "40": "tabboard!\u201d I heard that just as plain as if the man was by my side. There was a little gray in the sky now; so I stepped into th", "41": "e woods, and laid down for a nap before breakfast. CHAPTER VIII. The sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after ", "42": "eight o\u2019clock. I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about things, and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and", "43": " satisfied. I could see the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big trees all about, and gloomy in there amongst them", "44": ". There was freckled places on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the freckled places swapped about ", "45": "a little, showing there was a little breeze up there. A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me very friendly. I wa", "46": "s powerful lazy and comfortable\u2014didn\u2019t want to get up and cook breakfast. Well, I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a d", "47": "eep sound of \u201cboom!\u201d away up the river. I rouses up, and rests on my elbow and listens; pretty soon I hears it again. I hopped u", "48": "p, and went and looked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke laying on the water a long ways up\u2014about abreast ", "49": "the ferry. And there was the ferryboat full of people floating along down. I knowed what was the matter now. \u201cBoom!\u201d I see the w", "50": "hite smoke squirt out of the ferryboat\u2019s side. You see, they was firing cannon over the water, trying to make my carcass come to", "51": " the top. I was pretty hungry, but it warn\u2019t going to do for me to start a fire, because they might see the smoke. So I set ther", "52": "e and watched the cannonsmoke and listened to the boom. The river was a mile wide there, and it always looks pretty on a summer ", "53": "morning\u2014so I was having a good enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite to eat. Well, then I happened", "54": " to think how they always put quicksilver in loaves of bread and float them off, because they always go right to the drownded ca", "55": "rcass and stop there. So, says I, I\u2019ll keep a lookout, and if any of them\u2019s floating around after me I\u2019ll give them a show. I ch", "56": "anged to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could have, and I warn\u2019t disappointed. A big double loaf come along,", "57": " and I most got it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and she floated out further. Of course I was where the current set in ", "58": "the closest to the shore\u2014I knowed enough for that. But byandby along comes another one, and this time I won. I took out the plug", "59": " and shook out the little dab of quicksilver, and set my teeth in. It was \u201cbaker\u2019s bread\u201d\u2014what the quality eat; none of your low", "60": "down cornpone. I got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching the bread and watching the ferryboat, and", "61": " very well satisfied. And then something struck me. I says, now I reckon the widow or the parson or somebody prayed that this br", "62": "ead would find me, and here it has gone and done it. So there ain\u2019t no doubt but there is something in that thing\u2014that is, there", "63": "\u2019s something in it when a body like the widow or the parson prays, but it don\u2019t work for me, and I reckon it don\u2019t work for only", "64": " just the right kind. I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke, and went on watching. The ferryboat was floating with the current,"}, "46": {"1": " and I allowed I\u2019d have a chance to see who was aboard when she come along, because she would come in close, where the bread did", "2": ". When she\u2019d got pretty well along down towards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread, and laid down be", "3": "hind a log on the bank in a little open place. Where the log forked I could peep through. Byandby she come along, and she drifte", "4": "d in so close that they could a run out a plank and walked ashore. Most everybody was on the boat. Pap, and Judge Thatcher, and ", "5": "Bessie Thatcher, and Jo Harper, and Tom Sawyer, and his old Aunt Polly, and Sid and Mary, and plenty more. Everybody was talking", "6": " about the murder, but the captain broke in and says: \u201cLook sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and maybe he\u2019s was", "7": "hed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water\u2019s edge. I hope so, anyway.\u201d I didn\u2019t hope so. They all crowded up and ", "8": "leaned over the rails, nearly in my face, and kept still, watching with all their might. I could see them firstrate, but they co", "9": "uldn\u2019t see me. Then the captain sung out: \u201cStand away!\u201d and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that it made me deef", "10": " with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke, and I judged I was gone. If they\u2019d a had some bullets in, I reckon they\u2019d ", "11": "a got the corpse they was after. Well, I see I warn\u2019t hurt, thanks to goodness. The boat floated on and went out of sight around", "12": " the shoulder of the island. I could hear the booming now and then, further and further off, and byandby, after an hour, I didn\u2019", "13": "t hear it no more. The island was three mile long. I judged they had got to the foot, and was giving it up. But they didn\u2019t yet ", "14": "a while. They turned around the foot of the island and started up the channel on the Missouri side, under steam, and booming onc", "15": "e in a while as they went. I crossed over to that side and watched them. When they got abreast the head of the island they quit ", "16": "shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and went home to the town. I knowed I was all right now. Nobody else would come ", "17": "ahunting after me. I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick woods. I made a kind of a tent out of my", "18": " blankets to put my things under so the rain couldn\u2019t get at them. I catched a catfish and haggled him open with my saw, and tow", "19": "ards sundown I started my camp fire and had supper. Then I set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast. When it was dark I s", "20": "et by my camp fire smoking, and feeling pretty well satisfied; but byandby it got sort of lonesome, and so I went and set on the", "21": " bank and listened to the current swashing along, and counted the stars and drift logs and rafts that come down, and then went t", "22": "o bed; there ain\u2019t no better way to put in time when you are lonesome; you can\u2019t stay so, you soon get over it. And so for three", "23": " days and nights. No difference\u2014just the same thing. But the next day I went exploring around down through the island. I was bos", "24": "s of it; it all belonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to know all about it; but mainly I wanted to put in the time. I found pl", "25": "enty strawberries, ripe and prime; and green summer grapes, and green razberries; and the green blackberries was just beginning ", "26": "to show. They would all come handy byandby, I judged. Well, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn\u2019t far fr", "27": "om the foot of the island. I had my gun along, but I hadn\u2019t shot nothing; it was for protection; thought I would kill some game ", "28": "nigh home. About this time I mighty near stepped on a goodsized snake, and it went sliding off through the grass and flowers, an", "29": "d I after it, trying to get a shot at it. I clipped along, and all of a sudden I bounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire th", "30": "at was still smoking. My heart jumped up amongst my lungs. I never waited for to look further, but uncocked my gun and went snea", "31": "king back on my tiptoes as fast as ever I could. Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the thick leaves and listened, bu", "32": "t my breath come so hard I couldn\u2019t hear nothing else. I slunk along another piece further, then listened again; and so on, and ", "33": "so on. If I see a stump, I took it for a man; if I trod on a stick and broke it, it made me feel like a person had cut one of my", "34": " breaths in two and I only got half, and the short half, too. When I got to camp I warn\u2019t feeling very brash, there warn\u2019t much ", "35": "sand in my craw; but I says, this ain\u2019t no time to be fooling around. So I got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have th", "36": "em out of sight, and I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an old last year\u2019s camp, and then clumb a tr", "37": "ee. I reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn\u2019t see nothing, I didn\u2019t hear nothing\u2014I only _thought_ I heard and seen a", "38": "s much as a thousand things. Well, I couldn\u2019t stay up there forever; so at last I got down, but I kept in the thick woods and on", "39": " the lookout all the time. All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from breakfast. By the time it was night I ", "40": "was pretty hungry. So when it was good and dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the Illinois bank\u2014abou", "41": "t a quarter of a mile. I went out in the woods and cooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay there all night", "42": " when I hear a _plunketyplunk, plunketyplunk_, and says to myself, horses coming; and next I hear people\u2019s voices. I got everyth", "43": "ing into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went creeping through the woods to see what I could find out. I hadn\u2019t got far ", "44": "when I hear a man say: \u201cWe better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is about beat out. Let\u2019s look around.\u201d I did", "45": "n\u2019t wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy. I tied up in the old place, and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe. I didn\u2019t sl", "46": "eep much. I couldn\u2019t, somehow, for thinking. And every time I waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck. So the sleep didn\u2019", "47": "t do me no good. Byandby I says to myself, I can\u2019t live this way; I\u2019m agoing to find out who it is that\u2019s here on the island wit", "48": "h me; I\u2019ll find it out or bust. Well, I felt better right off. So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, a", "49": "nd then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows. The moon was shining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as l", "50": "ight as day. I poked along well on to an hour, everything still as rocks and sound asleep. Well, by this time I was most down to", "51": " the foot of the island. A little ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good as saying the night was about done. I ", "52": "give her a turn with the paddle and brung her nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edge of the woods. I", "53": " sat down there on a log, and looked out through the leaves. I see the moon go off watch, and the darkness begin to blanket the ", "54": "river. But in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetops, and knowed the day was coming. So I took my gun and slipped ", "55": "off towards where I had run across that camp fire, stopping every minute or two to listen. But I hadn\u2019t no luck somehow; I could", "56": "n\u2019t seem to find the place. But byandby, sure enough, I catched a glimpse of fire away through the trees. I went for it, cautiou", "57": "s and slow. Byandby I was close enough to have a look, and there laid a man on the ground. It most give me the fantods. He had a", "58": " blanket around his head, and his head was nearly in the fire. I set there behind a clump of bushes, in about six foot of him, a", "59": "nd kept my eyes on him steady. It was getting gray daylight now. Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove off the bl", "60": "anket, and it was Miss Watson\u2019s Jim! I bet I was glad to see him. I says: \u201cHello, Jim!\u201d and skipped out. He bounced up and stare", "61": "d at me wild.

This place was a tolerable long, steep hill or ridge about forty foot high. We had a rough time getting to the ", "25": "top, the sides was so steep and the bushes so thick. We tramped and clumb around all over it, and byandby found a good big caver", "26": "n in the rock, most up to the top on the side towards Illinois. The cavern was as big as two or three rooms bunched together, an", "27": "d Jim could stand up straight in it. It was cool in there. Jim was for putting our traps in there right away, but I said we didn", "28": "\u2019t want to be climbing up and down there all the time. Jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the traps i", "29": "n the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island, and they would never find us without dogs. And, besides,", "30": " he said them little birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want the things to get wet? So we went back and got the cano", "31": "e, and paddled up abreast the cavern, and lugged all the traps up there. Then we hunted up a place close by to hide the canoe in", "32": ", amongst the thick willows. We took some fish off of the lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner. The door ", "33": "of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit, and was flat a", "34": "nd a good place to build a fire on. So we built it there and cooked dinner. We spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat ", "35": "our dinner in there. We put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern. Pretty soon it darkened up, and begun to thund", "36": "er and lighten; so the birds was right about it. Directly it begun to rain, and it rained like all fury, too, and I never see th", "37": "e wind blow so. It was one of these regular summer storms. It would get so dark that it looked all blueblack outside, and lovely", "38": "; and the rain would thrash along by so thick that the trees off a little ways looked dim and spiderwebby; and here would come a", "39": " blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up the pale underside of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper of a gust ", "40": "would follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they was just wild; and next, when it was just about the blu", "41": "est and blackest\u2014_fst!_ it was as bright as glory, and you\u2019d have a little glimpse of treetops aplunging about away off yonder i", "42": "n the storm, hundreds of yards further than you could see before; dark as sin again in a second, and now you\u2019d hear the thunder ", "43": "let go with an awful crash, and then go rumbling, grumbling, tumbling, down the sky towards the under side of the world, like ro", "44": "lling empty barrels down stairs\u2014where it\u2019s long stairs and they bounce a good deal, you know. \u201cJim, this is nice,\u201d I says. \u201cI wo", "45": "uldn\u2019t want to be nowhere else but here.

Chickens knows when it\u2019s gwyne to rain, en so do de birds, chile.\u201d The river went on raising and raising for ten or twel", "48": "ve days, till at last it was over the banks. The water was three or four foot deep on the island in the low places and on the Il", "49": "linois bottom. On that side it was a good many miles wide, but on the Missouri side it was the same old distance across\u2014a half a", "50": " mile\u2014because the Missouri shore was just a wall of high bluffs. Daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe, It was mi", "51": "ghty cool and shady in the deep woods, even if the sun was blazing outside. We went winding in and out amongst the trees, and so", "52": "metimes the vines hung so thick we had to back away and go some other way. Well, on every old brokendown tree you could see rabb", "53": "its and snakes and such things; and when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame, on account of being hungr", "54": "y, that you could paddle right up and put your hand on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and turtles\u2014they would slide of", "55": "f in the water. The ridge our cavern was in was full of them. We could a had pets enough if we\u2019d wanted them. One night we catch", "56": "ed a little section of a lumber raft\u2014nice pine planks. It was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long, and the t", "57": "op stood above water six or seven inches\u2014a solid, level floor. We could see sawlogs go by in the daylight sometimes, but we let ", "58": "them go; we didn\u2019t show ourselves in daylight. Another night when we was up at the head of the island, just before daylight, her", "59": "e comes a framehouse down, on the west side. She was a twostory, and tilted over considerable. We paddled out and got aboard\u2014clu", "60": "mb in at an upstairs window. But it was too dark to see yet, so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight. The ", "61": "light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island. Then we looked in at the window. We could make out a bed, and a tab", "62": "le, and two old chairs, and lots of things around about on the floor, and there was clothes hanging against the wall. There was ", "63": "something laying on the floor in the far corner that looked like a man. So Jim says: \u201cHello, you!\u201d But it didn\u2019t budge. So I hol", "64": "lered again, and then Jim says: \u201cDe man ain\u2019t asleep\u2014he\u2019s dead.

Jim throwed some old rags over him, but he", "3": " needn\u2019t done it; I didn\u2019t want to see him. There was heaps of old greasy cards scattered around over the floor, and old whisky ", "4": "bottles, and a couple of masks made out of black cloth; and all over the walls was the ignorantest kind of words and pictures ma", "5": "de with charcoal. There was two old dirty calico dresses, and a sunbonnet, and some women\u2019s underclothes hanging against the wal", "6": "l, and some men\u2019s clothing, too. We put the lot into the canoe\u2014it might come good. There was a boy\u2019s old speckled straw hat on t", "7": "he floor; I took that, too. And there was a bottle that had had milk in it, and it had a rag stopper for a baby to suck. We woul", "8": "d a took the bottle, but it was broke. There was a seedy old chest, and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke. They stood open", "9": ", but there warn\u2019t nothing left in them that was any account. The way things was scattered about we reckoned the people left in ", "10": "a hurry, and warn\u2019t fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff. We got an old tin lantern, and a butcherknife without any hand", "11": "le, and a brannew Barlow knife worth two bits in any store, and a lot of tallow candles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and", "12": " a tin cup, and a ratty old bedquilt off the bed, and a reticule with needles and pins and beeswax and buttons and thread and al", "13": "l such truck in it, and a hatchet and some nails, and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some monstrous hooks on it, a", "14": "nd a roll of buckskin, and a leather dogcollar, and a horseshoe, and some vials of medicine that didn\u2019t have no label on them; a", "15": "nd just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good currycomb, and Jim he found a ratty old fiddlebow, and a wooden leg. The stra", "16": "ps was broke off of it, but, barring that, it was a good enough leg, though it was too long for me and not long enough for Jim, ", "17": "and we couldn\u2019t find the other one, though we hunted all around. And so, take it all around, we made a good haul. When we was re", "18": "ady to shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it was pretty broad day; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe a", "19": "nd cover up with the quilt, because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good ways off. I paddled over to the Illino", "20": "is shore, and drifted down most a half a mile doing it. I crept up the dead water under the bank, and hadn\u2019t no accidents and di", "21": "dn\u2019t see nobody. We got home all safe. CHAPTER X. After breakfast I wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he come ", "22": "to be killed, but Jim didn\u2019t want to. He said it would fetch bad luck; and besides, he said, he might come and ha\u2019nt us; he said", "23": " a man that warn\u2019t buried was more likely to go aha\u2019nting around than one that was planted and comfortable. That sounded pretty ", "24": "reasonable, so I didn\u2019t say no more; but I couldn\u2019t keep from studying over it and wishing I knowed who shot the man, and what t", "25": "hey done it for. We rummaged the clothes we\u2019d got, and found eight dollars in silver sewed up in the lining of an old blanket ov", "26": "ercoat. Jim said he reckoned the people in that house stole the coat, because if they\u2019d a knowed the money was there they wouldn", "27": "\u2019t a left it. I said I reckoned they killed him, too; but Jim didn\u2019t want to talk about that. I says: \u201cNow you think it\u2019s bad lu", "28": "ck; but what did you say when I fetched in the snakeskin that I found on the top of the ridge day before yesterday? You said it ", "29": "was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snakeskin with my hands. Well, here\u2019s your bad luck! We\u2019ve raked in all this truc", "30": "k and eight dollars besides. I wish we could have some bad luck like this every day, Jim.\u201d \u201cNever you mind, honey, never you min", "31": "d. Don\u2019t you git too peart. It\u2019s acomin\u2019. Mind I tell you, it\u2019s acomin\u2019.\u201d It did come, too. It was a Tuesday that we had that ta", "32": "lk. Well, after dinner Friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of the ridge, and got out of tobacco. I went to", "33": " the cavern to get some, and found a rattlesnake in there. I killed him, and curled him up on the foot of Jim\u2019s blanket, ever so", "34": " natural, thinking there\u2019d be some fun when Jim found him there. Well, by night I forgot all about the snake, and when Jim flung", "35": " himself down on the blanket while I struck a light the snake\u2019s mate was there, and bit him. He jumped up yelling, and the first", "36": " thing the light showed was the varmint curled up and ready for another spring. I laid him out in a second with a stick, and Jim", "37": " grabbed pap\u2019s whiskyjug and begun to pour it down. He was barefooted, and the snake bit him right on the heel. That all comes o", "38": "f my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it. ", "39": "Jim told me to chop off the snake\u2019s head and throw it away, and then skin the body and roast a piece of it. I done it, and he ea", "40": "t it and said it would help cure him. He made me take off the rattles and tie them around his wrist, too. He said that that woul", "41": "d help. Then I slid out quiet and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for I warn\u2019t going to let Jim find out it wa", "42": "s all my fault, not if I could help it. Jim sucked and sucked at the jug, and now and then he got out of his head and pitched ar", "43": "ound and yelled; but every time he come to himself he went to sucking at the jug again. His foot swelled up pretty big, and so d", "44": "id his leg; but byandby the drunk begun to come, and so I judged he was all right; but I\u2019d druther been bit with a snake than pa", "45": "p\u2019s whisky. Jim was laid up for four days and nights. Then the swelling was all gone and he was around again. I made up my mind ", "46": "I wouldn\u2019t ever take aholt of a snakeskin again with my hands, now that I see what had come of it. Jim said he reckoned I would ", "47": "believe him next time. And he said that handling a snakeskin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn\u2019t got to the end of it y", "48": "et. He said he druther see the new moon over his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snakeskin in his hand.", "49": " Well, I was getting to feel that way myself, though I\u2019ve always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder i", "50": "s one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do. Old Hank Bunker done it once, and bragged about it; and in less th", "51": "an two years he got drunk and fell off of the shottower, and spread himself out so that he was just a kind of a layer, as you ma", "52": "y say; and they slid him edgeways between two barn doors for a coffin, and buried him so, so they say, but I didn\u2019t see it. Pap ", "53": "told me. But anyway it all come of looking at the moon that way, like a fool. Well, the days went along, and the river went down", "54": " between its banks again; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it an", "55": "d catch a catfish that was as big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two hundred pounds. We couldn\u2019t han", "56": "dle him, of course; he would a flung us into Illinois. We just set there and watched him rip and tear around till he drownded. W", "57": "e found a brass button in his stomach and a round ball, and lots of rubbage. We split the ball open with the hatchet, and there ", "58": "was a spool in it. Jim said he\u2019d had it there a long time, to coat it over so and make a ball of it. It was as big a fish as was", "59": " ever catched in the Mississippi, I reckon. Jim said he hadn\u2019t ever seen a bigger one. He would a been worth a good deal over at", "60": " the village. They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the markethouse there; everybody buys some of him; his meat\u2019s ", "61": "as white as snow and makes a good fry. Next morning I said it was getting slow and dull, and I wanted to get a stirring up some ", "62": "way. I said I reckoned I would slip over the river and find out what was going on. Jim liked that notion; but he said I must go ", "63": "in the dark and look sharp. Then he studied it over and said, couldn\u2019t I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl", "64": "? That was a good notion, too. So we shortened up one of the calico gowns, and I turned up my trouserlegs to my knees and got in"}, "50": {"1": "to it. Jim hitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit. I put on the sunbonnet and tied it under my chin, and then f", "2": "or a body to look in and see my face was like looking down a joint of stovepipe. Jim said nobody would know me, even in the dayt", "3": "ime, hardly. I practiced around all day to get the hang of the things, and byandby I could do pretty well in them, only Jim said", "4": " I didn\u2019t walk like a girl; and he said I must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britchespocket. I took notice, and done bett", "5": "er. I started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just after dark. I started across to the town from a little below the ferryland", "6": "ing, and the drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town. I tied up and started along the bank. There was a lig", "7": "ht burning in a little shanty that hadn\u2019t been lived in for a long time, and I wondered who had took up quarters there. I slippe", "8": "d up and peeped in at the window. There was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by a candle that was on a pine table.", "9": " I didn\u2019t know her face; she was a stranger, for you couldn\u2019t start a face in that town that I didn\u2019t know. Now this was lucky, ", "10": "because I was weakening; I was getting afraid I had come; people might know my voice and find me out. But if this woman had been", "11": " in such a little town two days she could tell me all I wanted to know; so I knocked at the door, and made up my mind I wouldn\u2019t", "12": " forget I was a girl.

When I struck the head of the island I never waited to blow, though", "52": " I was most winded, but I shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be, and started a good fire there on a high and", "53": " dry spot. Then I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place, a mile and a half below, as hard as I could go. I landed, and s", "54": "lopped through the timber and up the ridge and into the cavern.

By that time everything we had in th", "57": "e world was on our raft, and she was ready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid. We put out the camp fire at ", "58": "the cavern the first thing, and didn\u2019t show a candle outside after that. I took the canoe out from the shore a little piece, and", "59": " took a look; but if there was a boat around I couldn\u2019t see it, for stars and shadows ain\u2019t good to see by. Then we got out the ", "60": "raft and slipped along down in the shade, past the foot of the island dead still\u2014never saying a word. CHAPTER XII. It must a bee", "61": "n close on to one o\u2019clock when we got below the island at last, and the raft did seem to go mighty slow. If a boat was to come a", "62": "long we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinois shore; and it was well a boat didn\u2019t come, for we hadn\u2019t ever ", "63": "thought to put the gun in the canoe, or a fishingline, or anything to eat. We was in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so m", "64": "any things. It warn\u2019t good judgment to put _everything_ on the raft. If the men went to the island I just expect they found the "}, "52": {"1": "camp fire I built, and watched it all night for Jim to come. Anyways, they stayed away from us, and if my building the fire neve", "2": "r fooled them it warn\u2019t no fault of mine. I played it as low down on them as I could. When the first streak of day began to show", "3": " we tied up to a towhead in a big bend on the Illinois side, and hacked off cottonwood branches with the hatchet, and covered up", "4": " the raft with them so she looked like there had been a cavein in the bank there. A towhead is a sandbar that has cottonwoods on", "5": " it as thick as harrowteeth. We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois side, and the channel was d", "6": "own the Missouri shore at that place, so we warn\u2019t afraid of anybody running across us. We laid there all day, and watched the r", "7": "afts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore, and upbound steamboats fight the big river in the middle. I told Jim all about", "8": " the time I had jabbering with that woman; and Jim said she was a smart one, and if she was to start after us herself _she_ woul", "9": "dn\u2019t set down and watch a camp fire\u2014no, sir, she\u2019d fetch a dog. Well, then, I said, why couldn\u2019t she tell her husband to fetch a", "10": " dog? Jim said he bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start, and he believed they must a gone uptown to get", "11": " a dog and so they lost all that time, or else we wouldn\u2019t be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile below the village\u2014no, ", "12": "indeedy, we would be in that same old town again. So I said I didn\u2019t care what was the reason they didn\u2019t get us as long as they", "13": " didn\u2019t. When it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the cottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and acro", "14": "ss; nothing in sight; so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug wigwam to get under in blazing weather ", "15": "and rainy, and to keep the things dry. Jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above the level of the raft", "16": ", so now the blankets and all the traps was out of reach of steamboat waves. Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a layer o", "17": "f dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for to hold it to its place; this was to build a fire on in sloppy w", "18": "eather or chilly; the wigwam would keep it from being seen. We made an extra steeringoar, too, because one of the others might g", "19": "et broke on a snag or something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern on, because we must always light the l", "20": "antern whenever we see a steamboat coming downstream, to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn\u2019t have to light it for upstre", "21": "am boats unless we see we was in what they call a \u201ccrossing\u201d; for the river was pretty high yet, very low banks being still a li", "22": "ttle under water; so upbound boats didn\u2019t always run the channel, but hunted easy water.

I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water", "20": " out of my nose, and puffed a bit. Of course there was a booming current; and of course that boat started her engines again ten ", "21": "seconds after she stopped them, for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now she was churning along up the river, out of sight", "22": " in the thick weather, though I could hear her.

It was one of these long, slanting, twomile crossings; so I was a good long time in getting over. I made a safe landing,", "26": " and clumb up the bank.

Says I: \u201cGoodness sakes, would a runaway nigger run _south?_\u201d No, they", "38": " allowed he wouldn\u2019t. I had to account for things some way, so I says: \u201cMy folks was living in Pike County, in Missouri, where I", "39": " was born, and they all died off but me and pa and my brother Ike. Pa, he \u2019lowed he\u2019d break up and go down and live with Uncle B", "40": "en, who\u2019s got a little onehorse place on the river, fortyfour mile below Orleans. Pa was pretty poor, and had some debts; so whe", "41": "n he\u2019d squared up there warn\u2019t nothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger, Jim. That warn\u2019t enough to take us fourteen hund", "42": "red mile, deck passage nor no other way. Well, when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day; he ketched this piece of a r", "43": "aft; so we reckoned we\u2019d go down to Orleans on it. Pa\u2019s luck didn\u2019t hold out; a steamboat run over the forrard corner of the raf", "44": "t one night, and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel; Jim and me come up all right, but pa was drunk, and Ike was onl", "45": "y four years old, so they never come up no more. Well, for the next day or two we had considerable trouble, because people was a", "46": "lways coming out in skiffs and trying to take Jim away from me, saying they believed he was a runaway nigger. We don\u2019t run dayti", "47": "mes no more now; nights they don\u2019t bother us.\u201d The duke says: \u201cLeave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime i", "48": "f we want to. I\u2019ll think the thing over\u2014I\u2019ll invent a plan that\u2019ll fix it.

So the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam, to see what the beds was like. My bed was ", "52": "a straw tick better than Jim\u2019s, which was a cornshuck tick; there\u2019s always cobs around about in a shuck tick, and they poke into", "53": " you and hurt; and when you roll over the dry shucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves; it makes such a r", "54": "ustling that you wake up.

He says: \u201cI should a re", "55": "ckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you that a cornshuck bed warn\u2019t just fitten for me to sleep on. Your Grace\u2019ll ", "56": "take the shuck bed yourself.\u201d Jim and me was in a sweat again for a minute, being afraid there was going to be some more trouble", "57": " amongst them; so we was pretty glad when the duke says: \u201c\u2019Tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of ", "58": "oppression. Misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit; I yield, I submit; \u2019tis my fate. I am alone in the world\u2014let me suffer", "59": "; I can bear it.\u201d We got away as soon as it was good and dark. The king told us to stand well out towards the middle of the rive", "60": "r, and not show a light till we got a long ways below the town. We come in sight of the little bunch of lights byandby\u2014that was ", "61": "the town, you know\u2014and slid by, about a half a mile out, all right. When we was threequarters of a mile below we hoisted up our ", "62": "signal lantern; and about ten o\u2019clock it come on to rain and blow and thunder and lighten like everything; so the king told us t", "63": "o both stay on watch till the weather got better; then him and the duke crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night. It ", "64": "was my watch below till twelve, but I wouldn\u2019t a turned in anyway if I\u2019d had a bed, because a body don\u2019t see such a storm as tha"}, "67": {"1": "t every day in the week, not by a long sight.

The waves most washed me off the raft someti", "5": "mes, but I hadn\u2019t any clothes on, and didn\u2019t mind. We didn\u2019t have no trouble about snags; the lightning was glaring and flitteri", "6": "ng around so constant that we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way or that and miss them. I had the midd", "7": "le watch, you know, but I was pretty sleepy by that time, so Jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me; he was alwa", "8": "ys mighty good that way, Jim was. I crawled into the wigwam, but the king and the duke had their legs sprawled around so there w", "9": "arn\u2019t no show for me; so I laid outside\u2014I didn\u2019t mind the rain, because it was warm, and the waves warn\u2019t running so high now. A", "10": "bout two they come up again, though, and Jim was going to call me; but he changed his mind, because he reckoned they warn\u2019t high", "11": " enough yet to do any harm; but he was mistaken about that, for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a regular ripper and was", "12": "hed me overboard. It most killed Jim alaughing. He was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was, anyway. I took the watch, and ", "13": "Jim he laid down and snored away; and byandby the storm let up for good and all; and the first cabinlight that showed, I rousted", "14": " him out and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for the day. The king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast, and", "15": " him and the duke played sevenup a while, five cents a game. Then they got tired of it, and allowed they would \u201clay out a campai", "16": "gn,\u201d as they called it. The duke went down into his carpetbag, and fetched up a lot of little printed bills and read them out lo", "17": "ud. One bill said, \u201cThe celebrated Dr. Armand de Montalban, of Paris,\u201d would \u201clecture on the Science of Phrenology\u201d at such and ", "18": "such a place, on the blank day of blank, at ten cents admission, and \u201cfurnish charts of character at twentyfive cents apiece.\u201d T", "19": "he duke said that was _him_. In another bill he was the \u201cworldrenowned Shakespearian tragedian, Garrick the Younger, of Drury La", "20": "ne, London.\u201d In other bills he had a lot of other names and done other wonderful things, like finding water and gold with a \u201cdiv", "21": "iningrod,\u201d \u201cdissipating witch spells,\u201d and so on. Byandby he says: \u201cBut the histrionic muse is the darling. Have you ever trod t", "22": "he boards, Royalty?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d says the king. \u201cYou shall, then, before you\u2019re three days older, Fallen Grandeur,\u201d says the duke. \u201cTh", "23": "e first good town we come to we\u2019ll hire a hall and do the sword fight in Richard III. and the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet.", "24": " How does that strike you?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m in, up to the hub, for anything that will pay, Bilgewater; but, you see, I don\u2019t know nothing a", "25": "bout playactin\u2019, and hain\u2019t ever seen much of it.

I\u2019m jist afreezn\u2019 for something fresh, anyway.

The king was satisfied; so t", "33": "he duke got out his book and read the parts over in the most splendid spreadeagle way, prancing around and acting at the same ti", "34": "me, to show how it had got to be done; then he give the book to the king and told him to get his part by heart. There was a litt", "35": "le onehorse town about three mile down the bend, and after dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run in", "36": " daylight without it being dangersome for Jim; so he allowed he would go down to the town and fix that thing. The king allowed h", "37": "e would go, too, and see if he couldn\u2019t strike something. We was out of coffee, so Jim said I better go along with them in the c", "38": "anoe and get some. When we got there there warn\u2019t nobody stirring; streets empty, and perfectly dead and still, like Sunday. We ", "39": "found a sick nigger sunning himself in a back yard, and he said everybody that warn\u2019t too young or too sick or too old was gone ", "40": "to campmeeting, about two mile back in the woods. The king got the directions, and allowed he\u2019d go and work that campmeeting for", "41": " all it was worth, and I might go, too. The duke said what he was after was a printingoffice. We found it; a little bit of a con", "42": "cern, up over a carpenter shop\u2014carpenters and printers all gone to the meeting, and no doors locked. It was a dirty, litteredup ", "43": "place, and had ink marks, and handbills with pictures of horses and runaway niggers on them, all over the walls. The duke shed h", "44": "is coat and said he was all right now. So me and the king lit out for the campmeeting. We got there in about a half an hour fair", "45": "ly dripping, for it was a most awful hot day. There was as much as a thousand people there from twenty mile around. The woods wa", "46": "s full of teams and wagons, hitched everywheres, feeding out of the wagontroughs and stomping to keep off the flies. There was s", "47": "heds made out of poles and roofed over with branches, where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell, and piles of watermelons ", "48": "and green corn and suchlike truck. The preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds, only they was bigger and held crowd", "49": "s of people. The benches was made out of outside slabs of logs, with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into for legs", "50": ". They didn\u2019t have no backs. The preachers had high platforms to stand on at one end of the sheds. The women had on sunbonnets; ", "51": "and some had linseywoolsey frocks, some gingham ones, and a few of the young ones had on calico. Some of the young men was baref", "52": "ooted, and some of the children didn\u2019t have on any clothes but just a towlinen shirt. Some of the old women was knitting, and so", "53": "me of the young folks was courting on the sly. The first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn. He lined out two li", "54": "nes, everybody sung it, and it was kind of grand to hear it, there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way; t", "55": "hen he lined out two more for them to sing\u2014and so on. The people woke up more and more, and sung louder and louder; and towards ", "56": "the end some begun to groan, and some begun to shout. Then the preacher begun to preach, and begun in earnest, too; and went wea", "57": "ving first to one side of the platform and then the other, and then aleaning down over the front of it, with his arms and his bo", "58": "dy going all the time, and shouting his words out with all his might; and every now and then he would hold up his Bible and spre", "59": "ad it open, and kind of pass it around this way and that, shouting, \u201cIt\u2019s the brazen serpent in the wilderness! Look upon it and", "60": " live!\u201d And people would shout out, \u201cGlory!\u2014Aa_men!_\u201d And so he went on, and the people groaning and crying and saying amen: \u201cOh", "61": ", come to the mourners\u2019 bench! come, black with sin!

Then somebody sings out, \u201cTake up a collection for him, take up a collecti", "15": "on!\u201d Well, a half a dozen made a jump to do it, but somebody sings out, \u201cLet _him_ pass the hat around!\u201d Then everybody said it,", "16": " the preacher too. So the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eyes, and blessing the people and praising t", "17": "hem and thanking them for being so good to the poor pirates away off there; and every little while the prettiest kind of girls, ", "18": "with the tears running down their cheeks, would up and ask him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by; and he always ", "19": "done it; and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five or six times\u2014and he was invited to stay a week; and everybody wan", "20": "ted him to live in their houses, and said they\u2019d think it was an honor; but he said as this was the last day of the campmeeting ", "21": "he couldn\u2019t do no good, and besides he was in a sweat to get to the Indian Ocean right off and go to work on the pirates. When w", "22": "e got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had collected eightyseven dollars and seventyfive cents. And then he ", "23": "had fetched away a threegallon jug of whisky, too, that he found under a wagon when he was starting home through the woods. The ", "24": "king said, take it all around, it laid over any day he\u2019d ever put in in the missionarying line. He said it warn\u2019t no use talking", "25": ", heathens don\u2019t amount to shucks alongside of pirates to work a campmeeting with. The duke was thinking _he\u2019d_ been doing prett", "26": "y well till the king come to show up, but after that he didn\u2019t think so so much. He had set up and printed off two little jobs f", "27": "or farmers in that printingoffice\u2014horse bills\u2014and took the money, four dollars. And he had got in ten dollars\u2019 worth of advertis", "28": "ements for the paper, which he said he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in advance\u2014so they done it. The price of ", "29": "the paper was two dollars a year, but he took in three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them paying him in", "30": " advance; they were going to pay in cordwood and onions as usual, but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down th", "31": "e price as low as he could afford it, and was going to run it for cash. He set up a little piece of poetry, which he made, himse", "32": "lf, out of his own head\u2014three verses\u2014kind of sweet and saddish\u2014the name of it was, \u201cYes, crush, cold world, this breaking heart\u201d", "33": "\u2014and he left that all set up and ready to print in the paper, and didn\u2019t charge nothing for it. Well, he took in nine dollars an", "34": "d a half, and said he\u2019d done a pretty square day\u2019s work for it. Then he showed us another little job he\u2019d printed and hadn\u2019t cha", "35": "rged for, because it was for us.

We laid low and kept still, and never shoved out till nearly ten o\u2019clock; then we slid ", "46": "by, pretty wide away from the town, and didn\u2019t hoist our lantern till we was clear out of sight of it. When Jim called me to tak", "47": "e the watch at four in the morning, he says: \u201cHuck, does you reck\u2019n we gwyne to run acrost any mo\u2019 kings on dis trip?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I s", "48": "ays, \u201cI reckon not.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d says he, \u201cdat\u2019s all right, den.

Then the duke took and wrote out a sign on a shingle so: _Sick Arab\u2014but harmless when not out of", "63": " his head._ And he nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood the lath up four or five foot in front of the wigwam.

Why, he didn\u2019t only look like he", "4": " was dead, he looked considerable more than that. These rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because there was so much", "5": " money in it, but they judged it wouldn\u2019t be safe, because maybe the news might a worked along down by this time. They couldn\u2019t ", "6": "hit no project that suited exactly; so at last the duke said he reckoned he\u2019d lay off and work his brains an hour or two and see", "7": " if he couldn\u2019t put up something on the Arkansaw village; and the king he allowed he would drop over to t\u2019other village without ", "8": "any plan, but just trust in Providence to lead him the profitable way\u2014meaning the devil, I reckon.

Then we got allycumpain and rubbed on the place", "53": "s, and was pretty near all right again, but couldn\u2019t set down convenient. And so we went for the snakes, and grabbed a couple of", "54": " dozen garters and housesnakes, and put them in a bag, and put it in our room, and by that time it was suppertime, and a rattlin", "55": "g good honest day\u2019s work: and hungry?\u2014oh, no, I reckon not!

Jim didn\u2019t like the spiders, and the spiders didn\u2019t like Jim; and so they\u2019d lay for him, and make it might", "9": "y warm for him. And he said that between the rats and the snakes and the grindstone there warn\u2019t no room in bed for him, skasely", "10": "; and when there was, a body couldn\u2019t sleep, it was so lively, and it was always lively, he said, because _they_ never all slept", "11": " at one time, but took turn about, so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck, and when the rats turned in the snakes co", "12": "me on watch, so he always had one gang under him, in his way, and t\u2019other gang having a circus over him, and if he got up to hun", "13": "t a new place the spiders would take a chance at him as he crossed over.

He might have despised himself, for he had certain", "38": "ly taken her under false pretences.

HUCKLEBERRY FINN Scene: The Mississippi Valley Time: Forty to fifty years ago CHAPTER I. You do", "6": "n\u2019t know about me without you have read a book by the name of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain\u2019t no matter. That book ", "7": "was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. There was things which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. Th", "8": "at is nothing. I never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary. Aunt P", "9": "olly\u2014Tom\u2019s Aunt Polly, she is\u2014and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which is mostly a true book, with ", "10": "some stretchers, as I said before. Now the way that the book winds up is this: Tom and me found the money that the robbers hid i", "11": "n the cave, and it made us rich. We got six thousand dollars apiece\u2014all gold. It was an awful sight of money when it was piled u", "12": "p. Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year round\u2014more t", "13": "han a body could tell what to do with. The Widow Douglas she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was ", "14": "rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I c", "15": "ouldn\u2019t stand it no longer I lit out. I got into my old rags and my sugarhogshead again, and was free and satisfied. But Tom Saw", "16": "yer he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I would go back to the widow and be re", "17": "spectable. So I went back. The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she called me a lot of other names, ", "18": "too, but she never meant no harm by it. She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn\u2019t do nothing but sweat and sweat, and", "19": " feel all cramped up. Well, then, the old thing commenced again. The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come to time. ", "20": "When you got to the table you couldn\u2019t go right to eating, but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a", "21": " little over the victuals, though there warn\u2019t really anything the matter with them,\u2014that is, nothing only everything was cooked", "22": " by itself. In a barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the juice kind of swaps around, and the thing", "23": "s go better. After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out a", "24": "ll about him; but byandby she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so then I didn\u2019t care no more about ", "25": "him, because I don\u2019t take no stock in dead people. Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me. But she wouldn\u2019", "26": "t. She said it was a mean practice and wasn\u2019t clean, and I must try to not do it any more. That is just the way with some people", "27": ". They get down on a thing when they don\u2019t know nothing about it. Here she was abothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, ", "28": "and no use to anybody, being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a thing that had some good in it. And", "29": " she took snuff, too; of course that was all right, because she done it herself. Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old m", "30": "aid, with goggles on, had just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a spellingbook. She worked me middling hard ", "31": "for about an hour, and then the widow made her ease up. I couldn\u2019t stood it much longer. Then for an hour it was deadly dull, an", "32": "d I was fidgety. Miss Watson would say, \u201cDon\u2019t put your feet up there, Huckleberry;\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t scrunch up like that, Huckleberr", "33": "y\u2014set up straight;\u201d and pretty soon she would say, \u201cDon\u2019t gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry\u2014why don\u2019t you try to behave?\u201d T", "34": "hen she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished I was there. She got mad then, but I didn\u2019t mean no harm. All I wan", "35": "ted was to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn\u2019t particular. She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wo", "36": "uldn\u2019t say it for the whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place. Well, I couldn\u2019t see no advantage in goi", "37": "ng where she was going, so I made up my mind I wouldn\u2019t try for it. But I never said so, because it would only make trouble, and", "38": " wouldn\u2019t do no good. Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good place. She said all a body would h", "39": "ave to do there was to go around all day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever. So I didn\u2019t think much of it. But I never ", "40": "said so. I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer would go there, and she said not by a considerable sight. I was glad about that,", "41": " because I wanted him and me to be together. Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome. Byandby they ", "42": "fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then everybody was off to bed. I went up to my room with a piece of candle, and put ", "43": "it on the table. Then I set down in a chair by the window and tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn\u2019t no use. I felt", "44": " so lonesome I most wished I was dead. The stars were shining, and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard", "45": " an owl, away off, whowhooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to d", "46": "ie; and the wind was trying to whisper something to me, and I couldn\u2019t make out what it was, and so it made the cold shivers run", "47": " over me. Then away out in the woods I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something that\u2019", "48": "s on its mind and can\u2019t make itself understood, and so can\u2019t rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night gr", "49": "ieving. I got so downhearted and scared I did wish I had some company. Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I ", "50": "flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it was all shriveled up. I didn\u2019t need anybody to tell me that", "51": " that was an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared and most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and", "52": " turned around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied up a little lock of my hair with a thr", "53": "ead to keep witches away. But I hadn\u2019t no confidence. You do that when you\u2019ve lost a horseshoe that you\u2019ve found, instead of nai", "54": "ling it up over the door, but I hadn\u2019t ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you\u2019d killed a spider. I ", "55": "set down again, ashaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke; for the house was all as still as death now, and so the wido", "56": "w wouldn\u2019t know. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town go boom\u2014boom\u2014boom\u2014twelve licks; and all still ag", "57": "ain\u2014stiller than ever. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees\u2014something was a stirring. I set still ", "58": "and listened. Directly I could just barely hear a \u201c_meyow! meyow!_\u201d down there. That was good! Says I, \u201c_meyow! meyow!_\u201d as soft", "59": " as I could, and then I put out the light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed. Then I slipped down to the ground and ", "60": "crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough, there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me. CHAPTER II. We went tiptoeing along a path am", "61": "ongst the trees back towards the end of the widow\u2019s garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn\u2019t scrape our heads. When we ", "62": "was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made a noise. We scrouched down and laid still. Miss Watson\u2019s big nigger, name", "63": "d Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him pretty clear, because there was a light behind him. He got up and stret", "64": "ched his neck out about a minute, listening. Then he says: \u201cWho dah?\u201d He listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and sto"}, "165": {"1": "od right between us; we could a touched him, nearly. Well, likely it was minutes and minutes that there warn\u2019t a sound, and we a", "2": "ll there so close together. There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I dasn\u2019t scratch it; and then my ear begun to", "3": " itch; and next my back, right between my shoulders. Seemed like I\u2019d die if I couldn\u2019t scratch. Well, I\u2019ve noticed that thing pl", "4": "enty times since. If you are with the quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain\u2019t sleepy\u2014if you are anywhe", "5": "res where it won\u2019t do for you to scratch, why you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places. Pretty soon Jim says: \u201cSay", "6": ", who is you? Whar is you? Dog my cats ef I didn\u2019 hear sumf\u2019n. Well, I know what I\u2019s gwyne to do: I\u2019s gwyne to set down here and", "7": " listen tell I hears it agin.\u201d So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom. He leaned his back up against a tree, and stretc", "8": "hed his legs out till one of them most touched one of mine. My nose begun to itch. It itched till the tears come into my eyes. B", "9": "ut I dasn\u2019t scratch. Then it begun to itch on the inside. Next I got to itching underneath. I didn\u2019t know how I was going to set", "10": " still. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; but it seemed a sight longer than that. I was itching in ele", "11": "ven different places now. I reckoned I couldn\u2019t stand it more\u2019n a minute longer, but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try. J", "12": "ust then Jim begun to breathe heavy; next he begun to snore\u2014and then I was pretty soon comfortable again. Tom he made a sign to ", "13": "me\u2014kind of a little noise with his mouth\u2014and we went creeping away on our hands and knees. When we was ten foot off Tom whispere", "14": "d to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun. But I said no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they\u2019d find ou", "15": "t I warn\u2019t in. Then Tom said he hadn\u2019t got candles enough, and he would slip in the kitchen and get some more. I didn\u2019t want him", "16": " to try. I said Jim might wake up and come. But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there and got three candles, and Tom laid f", "17": "ive cents on the table for pay. Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing would do Tom but he must crawl to", "18": " where Jim was, on his hands and knees, and play something on him. I waited, and it seemed a good while, everything was so still", "19": " and lonesome. As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence, and byandby fetched up on the steep top o", "20": "f the hill the other side of the house. Tom said he slipped Jim\u2019s hat off of his head and hung it on a limb right over him, and ", "21": "Jim stirred a little, but he didn\u2019t wake. Afterwards Jim said the witches bewitched him and put him in a trance, and rode him al", "22": "l over the State, and then set him under the trees again, and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it. And next time Jim told", "23": " it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that, every time he told it he spread it more and more, till byandby h", "24": "e said they rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his back was all over saddleboils. Jim was monstrous p", "25": "roud about it, and he got so he wouldn\u2019t hardly notice the other niggers. Niggers would come miles to hear Jim tell about it, an", "26": "d he was more looked up to than any nigger in that country. Strange niggers would stand with their mouths open and look him all ", "27": "over, same as if he was a wonder. Niggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but whenever one was ", "28": "talking and letting on to know all about such things, Jim would happen in and say, \u201cHm! What you know \u2019bout witches?\u201d and that n", "29": "igger was corked up and had to take a back seat. Jim always kept that fivecenter piece round his neck with a string, and said it", "30": " was a charm the devil give to him with his own hands, and told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he ", "31": "wanted to just by saying something to it; but he never told what it was he said to it. Niggers would come from all around there ", "32": "and give Jim anything they had, just for a sight of that fivecenter piece; but they wouldn\u2019t touch it, because the devil had had", "33": " his hands on it. Jim was most ruined for a servant, because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil and been rode b", "34": "y witches. Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down into the village and could see three or four", "35": " lights twinkling, where there was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever so fine; and down by the village ", "36": "was the river, a whole mile broad, and awful still and grand. We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and Ben Rogers, and two ", "37": "or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard. So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half, to the", "38": " big scar on the hillside, and went ashore. We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the secret, and t", "39": "hen showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest part of the bushes. Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our han", "40": "ds and knees. We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave opened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soo", "41": "n ducked under a wall where you wouldn\u2019t a noticed that there was a hole. We went along a narrow place and got into a kind of ro", "42": "om, all damp and sweaty and cold, and there we stopped. Tom says: \u201cNow, we\u2019ll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer\u2019", "43": "s Gang. Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his name in blood.\u201d Everybody was willing. So Tom got ou", "44": "t a sheet of paper that he had wrote the oath on, and read it. It swore every boy to stick to the band, and never tell any of th", "45": "e secrets; and if anybody done anything to any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his family mus", "46": "t do it, and he mustn\u2019t eat and he mustn\u2019t sleep till he had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign", "47": " of the band. And nobody that didn\u2019t belong to the band could use that mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it ag", "48": "ain he must be killed. And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he must have his throat cut, and then have his", "49": " carcass burnt up and the ashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list with blood and never mentioned again ", "50": "by the gang, but have a curse put on it and be forgot forever. Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he ", "51": "got it out of his own head. He said, some of it, but the rest was out of piratebooks and robberbooks, and every gang that was hi", "52": "ghtoned had it. Some thought it would be good to kill the _families_ of boys that told the secrets. Tom said it was a good idea,", "53": " so he took a pencil and wrote it in. Then Ben Rogers says: \u201cHere\u2019s Huck Finn, he hain\u2019t got no family; what you going to do \u2019bo", "54": "ut him?\u201d \u201cWell, hain\u2019t he got a father?\u201d says Tom Sawyer. \u201cYes, he\u2019s got a father, but you can\u2019t never find him these days. He u", "55": "sed to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he hain\u2019t been seen in these parts for a year or more.\u201d They talked it over, ", "56": "and they was going to rule me out, because they said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it wouldn\u2019t be fa", "57": "ir and square for the others. Well, nobody could think of anything to do\u2014everybody was stumped, and set still. I was most ready ", "58": "to cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered them Miss Watson\u2014they could kill her. Everybody said: \u201cOh, she\u2019ll d", "59": "o. That\u2019s all right. Huck can come in.\u201d Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with, and I made my mark", "60": " on the paper. \u201cNow,\u201d says Ben Rogers, \u201cwhat\u2019s the line of business of this Gang?\u201d \u201cNothing only robbery and murder,\u201d Tom said. ", "61": "\u201cBut who are we going to rob?\u2014houses, or cattle, or\u2014\u201d \u201cStuff! stealing cattle and such things ain\u2019t robbery; it\u2019s burglary,\u201d say", "62": "s Tom Sawyer. \u201cWe ain\u2019t burglars. That ain\u2019t no sort of style. We are highwaymen. We stop stages and carriages on the road, with", "63": " masks on, and kill the people and take their watches and money.\u201d \u201cMust we always kill the people?\u201d \u201cOh, certainly. It\u2019s best. S", "64": "ome authorities think different, but mostly it\u2019s considered best to kill them\u2014except some that you bring to the cave here, and k"}, "166": {"1": "eep them till they\u2019re ransomed.\u201d \u201cRansomed? What\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. But that\u2019s what they do. I\u2019ve seen it in books; and so ", "2": "of course that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to do.\u201d \u201cBut how can we do it if we don\u2019t know what it is?\u201d \u201cWhy, blame it all, we\u2019ve _got_ to d", "3": "o it. Don\u2019t I tell you it\u2019s in the books? Do you want to go to doing different from what\u2019s in the books, and get things all mudd", "4": "led up?\u201d \u201cOh, that\u2019s all very fine to _say_, Tom Sawyer, but how in the nation are these fellows going to be ransomed if we don\u2019", "5": "t know how to do it to them?\u2014that\u2019s the thing _I_ want to get at. Now, what do you _reckon_ it is?\u201d \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know. But per", "6": "\u2019aps if we keep them till they\u2019re ransomed, it means that we keep them till they\u2019re dead.\u201d \u201cNow, that\u2019s something _like_. That\u2019l", "7": "l answer. Why couldn\u2019t you said that before? We\u2019ll keep them till they\u2019re ransomed to death; and a bothersome lot they\u2019ll be, to", "8": "o\u2014eating up everything, and always trying to get loose.\u201d \u201cHow you talk, Ben Rogers. How can they get loose when there\u2019s a guard ", "9": "over them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?\u201d \u201cA guard! Well, that _is_ good. So somebody\u2019s got to set up all night a", "10": "nd never get any sleep, just so as to watch them. I think that\u2019s foolishness. Why can\u2019t a body take a club and ransom them as so", "11": "on as they get here?\u201d \u201cBecause it ain\u2019t in the books so\u2014that\u2019s why. Now, Ben Rogers, do you want to do things regular, or don\u2019t ", "12": "you?\u2014that\u2019s the idea.

He said he\u2019d cowhide me till I was black and blue if I didn\u2019t raise some money for him. I borrowed three doll", "61": "ars from Judge Thatcher, and pap took it and got drunk, and went ablowing around and cussing and whooping and carrying on; and h", "62": "e kept it up all over town, with a tin pan, till most midnight; then they jailed him, and next day they had him before court, an", "63": "d jailed him again for a week. But he said _he_ was satisfied; said he was boss of his son, and he\u2019d make it warm for _him_. Whe", "64": "n he got out the new judge said he was agoing to make a man of him. So he took him to his own house, and dressed him up clean an"}, "169": {"1": "d nice, and had him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family, and was just old pie to him, so to speak. And after supp", "2": "er he talked to him about temperance and such things till the old man cried, and said he\u2019d been a fool, and fooled away his life", "3": "; but now he was agoing to turn over a new leaf and be a man nobody wouldn\u2019t be ashamed of, and he hoped the judge would help hi", "4": "m and not look down on him. The judge said he could hug him for them words; so _he_ cried, and his wife she cried again; pap sai", "5": "d he\u2019d been a man that had always been misunderstood before, and the judge said he believed it.

There\u2019s a hand that was t", "8": "he hand of a hog; but it ain\u2019t so no more; it\u2019s the hand of a man that\u2019s started in on a new life, and\u2019ll die before he\u2019ll go ba", "9": "ck.

The judge\u2019s wife she kissed it. Then the old man he signed a pledge\u2014made his mark. The judge s", "11": "aid it was the holiest time on record, or something like that. Then they tucked the old man into a beautiful room, which was the", "12": " spare room, and in the night some time he got powerful thirsty and clumb out on to the porchroof and slid down a stanchion and ", "13": "traded his new coat for a jug of fortyrod, and clumb back again and had a good old time; and towards daylight he crawled out aga", "14": "in, drunk as a fiddler, and rolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places, and was most froze to death when somebody", "15": " found him after sunup. And when they come to look at that spare room they had to take soundings before they could navigate it. ", "16": "The judge he felt kind of sore. He said he reckoned a body could reform the old man with a shotgun, maybe, but he didn\u2019t know no", "17": " other way. CHAPTER VI. Well, pretty soon the old man was up and around again, and then he went for Judge Thatcher in the courts", "18": " to make him give up that money, and he went for me, too, for not stopping school. He catched me a couple of times and thrashed ", "19": "me, but I went to school just the same, and dodged him or outrun him most of the time. I didn\u2019t want to go to school much before", "20": ", but I reckoned I\u2019d go now to spite pap. That law trial was a slow business\u2014appeared like they warn\u2019t ever going to get started", "21": " on it; so every now and then I\u2019d borrow two or three dollars off of the judge for him, to keep from getting a cowhiding. Every ", "22": "time he got money he got drunk; and every time he got drunk he raised Cain around town; and every time he raised Cain he got jai", "23": "led. He was just suited\u2014this kind of thing was right in his line. He got to hanging around the widow\u2019s too much and so she told ", "24": "him at last that if he didn\u2019t quit using around there she would make trouble for him. Well, _wasn\u2019t_ he mad? He said he would sh", "25": "ow who was Huck Finn\u2019s boss. So he watched out for me one day in the spring, and catched me, and took me up the river about thre", "26": "e mile in a skiff, and crossed over to the Illinois shore where it was woody and there warn\u2019t no houses but an old log hut in a ", "27": "place where the timber was so thick you couldn\u2019t find it if you didn\u2019t know where it was. He kept me with him all the time, and ", "28": "I never got a chance to run off. We lived in that old cabin, and he always locked the door and put the key under his head nights", "29": ". He had a gun which he had stole, I reckon, and we fished and hunted, and that was what we lived on. Every little while he lock", "30": "ed me in and went down to the store, three miles, to the ferry, and traded fish and game for whisky, and fetched it home and got", "31": " drunk and had a good time, and licked me. The widow she found out where I was byandby, and she sent a man over to try to get ho", "32": "ld of me; but pap drove him off with the gun, and it warn\u2019t long after that till I was used to being where I was, and liked it\u2014a", "33": "ll but the cowhide part. It was kind of lazy and jolly, laying off comfortable all day, smoking and fishing, and no books nor st", "34": "udy. Two months or more run along, and my clothes got to be all rags and dirt, and I didn\u2019t see how I\u2019d ever got to like it so w", "35": "ell at the widow\u2019s, where you had to wash, and eat on a plate, and comb up, and go to bed and get up regular, and be forever bot", "36": "hering over a book, and have old Miss Watson pecking at you all the time. I didn\u2019t want to go back no more. I had stopped cussin", "37": "g, because the widow didn\u2019t like it; but now I took to it again because pap hadn\u2019t no objections. It was pretty good times up in", "38": " the woods there, take it all around. But byandby pap got too handy with his hick\u2019ry, and I couldn\u2019t stand it. I was all over we", "39": "lts. He got to going away so much, too, and locking me in. Once he locked me in and was gone three days. It was dreadful lonesom", "40": "e. I judged he had got drownded, and I wasn\u2019t ever going to get out any more. I was scared. I made up my mind I would fix up som", "41": "e way to leave there. I had tried to get out of that cabin many a time, but I couldn\u2019t find no way. There warn\u2019t a window to it ", "42": "big enough for a dog to get through. I couldn\u2019t get up the chimbly; it was too narrow. The door was thick, solid oak slabs. Pap ", "43": "was pretty careful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away; I reckon I had hunted the place over as much ", "44": "as a hundred times; well, I was most all the time at it, because it was about the only way to put in the time. But this time I f", "45": "ound something at last; I found an old rusty woodsaw without any handle; it was laid in between a rafter and the clapboards of t", "46": "he roof. I greased it up and went to work. There was an old horseblanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin beh", "47": "ind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and putting the candle out. I got under the table and raised the", "48": " blanket, and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out\u2014big enough to let me through. Well, it was a good long job", "49": ", but I was getting towards the end of it when I heard pap\u2019s gun in the woods. I got rid of the signs of my work, and dropped th", "50": "e blanket and hid my saw, and pretty soon pap come in. Pap warn\u2019t in a good humor\u2014so he was his natural self. He said he was dow", "51": "n town, and everything was going wrong. His lawyer said he reckoned he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got ", "52": "started on the trial; but then there was ways to put it off a long time, and Judge Thatcher knowed how to do it. And he said peo", "53": "ple allowed there\u2019d be another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my guardian, and they guessed it would", "54": " win this time. This shook me up considerable, because I didn\u2019t want to go back to the widow\u2019s any more and be so cramped up and", "55": " sivilized, as they called it. Then the old man got to cussing, and cussed everything and everybody he could think of, and then ", "56": "cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn\u2019t skipped any, and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all ", "57": "round, including a considerable parcel of people which he didn\u2019t know the names of, and so called them what\u2019shisname when he got", "58": " to them, and went right along with his cussing. He said he would like to see the widow get me. He said he would watch out, and ", "59": "if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a place six or seven mile off to stow me in, where they might hunt till ", "60": "they dropped and they couldn\u2019t find me. That made me pretty uneasy again, but only for a minute; I reckoned I wouldn\u2019t stay on h", "61": "and till he got that chance. The old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had got. There was a fiftypound sack of", "62": " corn meal, and a side of bacon, ammunition, and a fourgallon jug of whisky, and an old book and two newspapers for wadding, bes", "63": "ides some tow. I toted up a load, and went back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest. I thought it all over, and I recko", "64": "ned I would walk off with the gun and some lines, and take to the woods when I run away. I guessed I wouldn\u2019t stay in one place,"}, "170": {"1": " but just tramp right across the country, mostly night times, and hunt and fish to keep alive, and so get so far away that the o", "2": "ld man nor the widow couldn\u2019t ever find me any more. I judged I would saw out and leave that night if pap got drunk enough, and ", "3": "I reckoned he would. I got so full of it I didn\u2019t notice how long I was staying till the old man hollered and asked me whether I", "4": " was asleep or drownded. I got the things all up to the cabin, and then it was about dark. While I was cooking supper the old ma", "5": "n took a swig or two and got sort of warmed up, and went to ripping again. He had been drunk over in town, and laid in the gutte", "6": "r all night, and he was a sight to look at. A body would a thought he was Adam\u2014he was just all mud. Whenever his liquor begun to", "7": " work he most always went for the govment, this time he says: \u201cCall this a govment! why, just look at it and see what it\u2019s like.", "8": " Here\u2019s the law astanding ready to take a man\u2019s son away from him\u2014a man\u2019s own son, which he has had all the trouble and all the ", "9": "anxiety and all the expense of raising.

Why, looky here. There was a free nigger there from Ohio\u2014a mulatter, most as white as a white man. He had the whitest", "20": " shirt on you ever see, too, and the shiniest hat; and there ain\u2019t a man in that town that\u2019s got as fine clothes as what he had;", "21": " and he had a gold watch and chain, and a silverheaded cane\u2014the awfulest old grayheaded nabob in the State.

But when I got to shore pap wasn\u2019t in sight yet, an", "17": "d as I was running her into a little creek like a gully, all hung over with vines and willows, I struck another idea: I judged I", "18": "\u2019d hide her good, and then, \u2019stead of taking to the woods when I run off, I\u2019d go down the river about fifty mile and camp in one", "19": " place for good, and not have such a rough time tramping on foot. It was pretty close to the shanty, and I thought I heard the o", "20": "ld man coming all the time; but I got her hid; and then I out and looked around a bunch of willows, and there was the old man do", "21": "wn the path a piece just drawing a bead on a bird with his gun. So he hadn\u2019t seen anything. When he got along I was hard at it t", "22": "aking up a \u201ctrot\u201d line. He abused me a little for being so slow; but I told him I fell in the river, and that was what made me s", "23": "o long. I knowed he would see I was wet, and then he would be asking questions. We got five catfish off the lines and went home.", "24": " While we laid off after breakfast to sleep up, both of us being about wore out, I got to thinking that if I could fix up some w", "25": "ay to keep pap and the widow from trying to follow me, it would be a certainer thing than trusting to luck to get far enough off", "26": " before they missed me; you see, all kinds of things might happen. Well, I didn\u2019t see no way for a while, but byandby pap raised", "27": " up a minute to drink another barrel of water, and he says: \u201cAnother time a man comes aprowling round here you roust me out, you", "28": " hear? That man warn\u2019t here for no good. I\u2019d a shot him. Next time you roust me out, you hear?\u201d Then he dropped down and went to", "29": " sleep again; but what he had been saying give me the very idea I wanted. I says to myself, I can fix it now so nobody won\u2019t thi", "30": "nk of following me. About twelve o\u2019clock we turned out and went along up the bank. The river was coming up pretty fast, and lots", "31": " of driftwood going by on the rise. Byandby along comes part of a log raft\u2014nine logs fast together. We went out with the skiff a", "32": "nd towed it ashore. Then we had dinner. Anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through, so as to catch more stuff; but ", "33": "that warn\u2019t pap\u2019s style. Nine logs was enough for one time; he must shove right over to town and sell. So he locked me in and to", "34": "ok the skiff, and started off towing the raft about halfpast three. I judged he wouldn\u2019t come back that night. I waited till I r", "35": "eckoned he had got a good start; then I out with my saw, and went to work on that log again. Before he was t\u2019other side of the r", "36": "iver I was out of the hole; him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder. I took the sack of corn meal and too", "37": "k it to where the canoe was hid, and shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in; then I done the same with the side of ba", "38": "con; then the whiskyjug. I took all the coffee and sugar there was, and all the ammunition; I took the wadding; I took the bucke", "39": "t and gourd; I took a dipper and a tin cup, and my old saw and two blankets, and the skillet and the coffeepot. I took fishlines", "40": " and matches and other things\u2014everything that was worth a cent. I cleaned out the place. I wanted an axe, but there wasn\u2019t any, ", "41": "only the one out at the woodpile, and I knowed why I was going to leave that. I fetched out the gun, and now I was done. I had w", "42": "ore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging out so many things. So I fixed that as good as I could from the", "43": " outside by scattering dust on the place, which covered up the smoothness and the sawdust. Then I fixed the piece of log back in", "44": "to its place, and put two rocks under it and one against it to hold it there, for it was bent up at that place and didn\u2019t quite ", "45": "touch ground. If you stood four or five foot away and didn\u2019t know it was sawed, you wouldn\u2019t never notice it; and besides, this ", "46": "was the back of the cabin, and it warn\u2019t likely anybody would go fooling around there. It was all grass clear to the canoe, so I", "47": " hadn\u2019t left a track. I followed around to see. I stood on the bank and looked out over the river. All safe. So I took the gun a", "48": "nd went up a piece into the woods, and was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig; hogs soon went wild in them bott", "49": "oms after they had got away from the prairie farms. I shot this fellow and took him into camp. I took the axe and smashed in the", "50": " door. I beat it and hacked it considerable adoing it. I fetched the pig in, and took him back nearly to the table and hacked in", "51": "to his throat with the axe, and laid him down on the ground to bleed; I say ground because it _was_ ground\u2014hard packed, and no b", "52": "oards. Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks in it\u2014all I could drag\u2014and I started it from the pig, and dragge", "53": "d it to the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in, and down it sunk, out of sight. You could easy see th", "54": "at something had been dragged over the ground. I did wish Tom Sawyer was there; I knowed he would take an interest in this kind ", "55": "of business, and throw in the fancy touches. Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as that. Well, last I p", "56": "ulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe good, and stuck it on the back side, and slung the axe in the corner. Then I took", "57": " up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn\u2019t drip) till I got a good piece below the house and then dump", "58": "ed him into the river. Now I thought of something else. So I went and got the bag of meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and f", "59": "etched them to the house. I took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in the bottom of it with the saw, for ther", "60": "e warn\u2019t no knives and forks on the place\u2014pap done everything with his claspknife about the cooking. Then I carried the sack abo", "61": "ut a hundred yards across the grass and through the willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile wide and ful", "62": "l of rushes\u2014and ducks too, you might say, in the season. There was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that ", "63": "went miles away, I don\u2019t know where, but it didn\u2019t go to the river. The meal sifted out and made a little track all the way to t", "64": "he lake. I dropped pap\u2019s whetstone there too, so as to look like it had been done by accident. Then I tied up the rip in the mea"}, "172": {"1": "l sack with a string, so it wouldn\u2019t leak no more, and took it and my saw to the canoe again. It was about dark now; so I droppe", "2": "d the canoe down the river under some willows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise. I made fast to a willow;", "3": " then I took a bite to eat, and byandby laid down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan. I says to myself, they\u2019ll fol", "4": "low the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then drag the river for me. And they\u2019ll follow that meal track to the la", "5": "ke and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers that killed me and took the things. They won\u2019t ever h", "6": "unt the river for anything but my dead carcass. They\u2019ll soon get tired of that, and won\u2019t bother no more about me. All right; I ", "7": "can stop anywhere I want to. Jackson\u2019s Island is good enough for me; I know that island pretty well, and nobody ever comes there", "8": ". And then I can paddle over to town nights, and slink around and pick up things I want. Jackson\u2019s Island\u2019s the place. I was pre", "9": "tty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep. When I woke up I didn\u2019t know where I was for a minute. I set up and looked", "10": " around, a little scared. Then I remembered. The river looked miles and miles across. The moon was so bright I could a counted t", "11": "he drift logs that went aslipping along, black and still, hundreds of yards out from shore. Everything was dead quiet, and it lo", "12": "oked late, and _smelt_ late. You know what I mean\u2014I don\u2019t know the words to put it in. I took a good gap and a stretch, and was ", "13": "just going to unhitch and start when I heard a sound away over the water. I listened. Pretty soon I made it out. It was that dul", "14": "l kind of a regular sound that comes from oars working in rowlocks when it\u2019s a still night. I peeped out through the willow bran", "15": "ches, and there it was\u2014a skiff, away across the water. I couldn\u2019t tell how many was in it. It kept acoming, and when it was abre", "16": "ast of me I see there warn\u2019t but one man in it. Think\u2019s I, maybe it\u2019s pap, though I warn\u2019t expecting him. He dropped below me wi", "17": "th the current, and byandby he came aswinging up shore in the easy water, and he went by so close I could a reached out the gun ", "18": "and touched him. Well, it _was_ pap, sure enough\u2014and sober, too, by the way he laid his oars. I didn\u2019t lose no time. The next mi", "19": "nute I was aspinning down stream soft but quick in the shade of the bank. I made two mile and a half, and then struck out a quar", "20": "ter of a mile or more towards the middle of the river, because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing, and people migh", "21": "t see me and hail me. I got out amongst the driftwood, and then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float. I laid t", "22": "here, and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe, looking away into the sky; not a cloud in it. The sky looks ever so deep w", "23": "hen you lay down on your back in the moonshine; I never knowed it before. And how far a body can hear on the water such nights! ", "24": "I heard people talking at the ferry landing. I heard what they said, too\u2014every word of it. One man said it was getting towards t", "25": "he long days and the short nights now. T\u2019other one said _this_ warn\u2019t one of the short ones, he reckoned\u2014and then they laughed, ", "26": "and he said it over again, and they laughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told him, and laughed, but he didn\u2019t la", "27": "ugh; he ripped out something brisk, and said let him alone. The first fellow said he \u2019lowed to tell it to his old woman\u2014she woul", "28": "d think it was pretty good; but he said that warn\u2019t nothing to some things he had said in his time. I heard one man say it was n", "29": "early three o\u2019clock, and he hoped daylight wouldn\u2019t wait more than about a week longer. After that the talk got further and furt", "30": "her away, and I couldn\u2019t make out the words any more; but I could hear the mumble, and now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed ", "31": "a long ways off. I was away below the ferry now. I rose up, and there was Jackson\u2019s Island, about two mile and a half down strea", "32": "m, heavy timbered and standing up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid, like a steamboat without any lights. T", "33": "here warn\u2019t any signs of the bar at the head\u2014it was all under water now. It didn\u2019t take me long to get there. I shot past the he", "34": "ad at a ripping rate, the current was so swift, and then I got into the dead water and landed on the side towards the Illinois s", "35": "hore. I run the canoe into a deep dent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willow branches to get in; and when I ", "36": "made fast nobody could a seen the canoe from the outside. I went up and set down on a log at the head of the island, and looked ", "37": "out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town, three mile away, where there was three or four lights tw", "38": "inkling. A monstrous big lumberraft was about a mile up stream, coming along down, with a lantern in the middle of it. I watched", "39": " it come creeping down, and when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say, \u201cStern oars, there! heave her head to s", "40": "tabboard!\u201d I heard that just as plain as if the man was by my side. There was a little gray in the sky now; so I stepped into th", "41": "e woods, and laid down for a nap before breakfast. CHAPTER VIII. The sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after ", "42": "eight o\u2019clock. I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about things, and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and", "43": " satisfied. I could see the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big trees all about, and gloomy in there amongst them", "44": ". There was freckled places on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the freckled places swapped about ", "45": "a little, showing there was a little breeze up there. A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me very friendly. I wa", "46": "s powerful lazy and comfortable\u2014didn\u2019t want to get up and cook breakfast. Well, I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a d", "47": "eep sound of \u201cboom!\u201d away up the river. I rouses up, and rests on my elbow and listens; pretty soon I hears it again. I hopped u", "48": "p, and went and looked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke laying on the water a long ways up\u2014about abreast ", "49": "the ferry. And there was the ferryboat full of people floating along down. I knowed what was the matter now. \u201cBoom!\u201d I see the w", "50": "hite smoke squirt out of the ferryboat\u2019s side. You see, they was firing cannon over the water, trying to make my carcass come to", "51": " the top. I was pretty hungry, but it warn\u2019t going to do for me to start a fire, because they might see the smoke. So I set ther", "52": "e and watched the cannonsmoke and listened to the boom. The river was a mile wide there, and it always looks pretty on a summer ", "53": "morning\u2014so I was having a good enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite to eat. Well, then I happened", "54": " to think how they always put quicksilver in loaves of bread and float them off, because they always go right to the drownded ca", "55": "rcass and stop there. So, says I, I\u2019ll keep a lookout, and if any of them\u2019s floating around after me I\u2019ll give them a show. I ch", "56": "anged to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could have, and I warn\u2019t disappointed. A big double loaf come along,", "57": " and I most got it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and she floated out further. Of course I was where the current set in ", "58": "the closest to the shore\u2014I knowed enough for that. But byandby along comes another one, and this time I won. I took out the plug", "59": " and shook out the little dab of quicksilver, and set my teeth in. It was \u201cbaker\u2019s bread\u201d\u2014what the quality eat; none of your low", "60": "down cornpone. I got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching the bread and watching the ferryboat, and", "61": " very well satisfied. And then something struck me. I says, now I reckon the widow or the parson or somebody prayed that this br", "62": "ead would find me, and here it has gone and done it. So there ain\u2019t no doubt but there is something in that thing\u2014that is, there", "63": "\u2019s something in it when a body like the widow or the parson prays, but it don\u2019t work for me, and I reckon it don\u2019t work for only", "64": " just the right kind. I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke, and went on watching. The ferryboat was floating with the current,"}, "173": {"1": " and I allowed I\u2019d have a chance to see who was aboard when she come along, because she would come in close, where the bread did", "2": ". When she\u2019d got pretty well along down towards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread, and laid down be", "3": "hind a log on the bank in a little open place. Where the log forked I could peep through. Byandby she come along, and she drifte", "4": "d in so close that they could a run out a plank and walked ashore. Most everybody was on the boat. Pap, and Judge Thatcher, and ", "5": "Bessie Thatcher, and Jo Harper, and Tom Sawyer, and his old Aunt Polly, and Sid and Mary, and plenty more. Everybody was talking", "6": " about the murder, but the captain broke in and says: \u201cLook sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and maybe he\u2019s was", "7": "hed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water\u2019s edge. I hope so, anyway.\u201d I didn\u2019t hope so. They all crowded up and ", "8": "leaned over the rails, nearly in my face, and kept still, watching with all their might. I could see them firstrate, but they co", "9": "uldn\u2019t see me. Then the captain sung out: \u201cStand away!\u201d and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that it made me deef", "10": " with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke, and I judged I was gone. If they\u2019d a had some bullets in, I reckon they\u2019d ", "11": "a got the corpse they was after. Well, I see I warn\u2019t hurt, thanks to goodness. The boat floated on and went out of sight around", "12": " the shoulder of the island. I could hear the booming now and then, further and further off, and byandby, after an hour, I didn\u2019", "13": "t hear it no more. The island was three mile long. I judged they had got to the foot, and was giving it up. But they didn\u2019t yet ", "14": "a while. They turned around the foot of the island and started up the channel on the Missouri side, under steam, and booming onc", "15": "e in a while as they went. I crossed over to that side and watched them. When they got abreast the head of the island they quit ", "16": "shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and went home to the town. I knowed I was all right now. Nobody else would come ", "17": "ahunting after me. I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick woods. I made a kind of a tent out of my", "18": " blankets to put my things under so the rain couldn\u2019t get at them. I catched a catfish and haggled him open with my saw, and tow", "19": "ards sundown I started my camp fire and had supper. Then I set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast. When it was dark I s", "20": "et by my camp fire smoking, and feeling pretty well satisfied; but byandby it got sort of lonesome, and so I went and set on the", "21": " bank and listened to the current swashing along, and counted the stars and drift logs and rafts that come down, and then went t", "22": "o bed; there ain\u2019t no better way to put in time when you are lonesome; you can\u2019t stay so, you soon get over it. And so for three", "23": " days and nights. No difference\u2014just the same thing. But the next day I went exploring around down through the island. I was bos", "24": "s of it; it all belonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to know all about it; but mainly I wanted to put in the time. I found pl", "25": "enty strawberries, ripe and prime; and green summer grapes, and green razberries; and the green blackberries was just beginning ", "26": "to show. They would all come handy byandby, I judged. Well, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn\u2019t far fr", "27": "om the foot of the island. I had my gun along, but I hadn\u2019t shot nothing; it was for protection; thought I would kill some game ", "28": "nigh home. About this time I mighty near stepped on a goodsized snake, and it went sliding off through the grass and flowers, an", "29": "d I after it, trying to get a shot at it. I clipped along, and all of a sudden I bounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire th", "30": "at was still smoking. My heart jumped up amongst my lungs. I never waited for to look further, but uncocked my gun and went snea", "31": "king back on my tiptoes as fast as ever I could. Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the thick leaves and listened, bu", "32": "t my breath come so hard I couldn\u2019t hear nothing else. I slunk along another piece further, then listened again; and so on, and ", "33": "so on. If I see a stump, I took it for a man; if I trod on a stick and broke it, it made me feel like a person had cut one of my", "34": " breaths in two and I only got half, and the short half, too. When I got to camp I warn\u2019t feeling very brash, there warn\u2019t much ", "35": "sand in my craw; but I says, this ain\u2019t no time to be fooling around. So I got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have th", "36": "em out of sight, and I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an old last year\u2019s camp, and then clumb a tr", "37": "ee. I reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn\u2019t see nothing, I didn\u2019t hear nothing\u2014I only _thought_ I heard and seen a", "38": "s much as a thousand things. Well, I couldn\u2019t stay up there forever; so at last I got down, but I kept in the thick woods and on", "39": " the lookout all the time. All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from breakfast. By the time it was night I ", "40": "was pretty hungry. So when it was good and dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the Illinois bank\u2014abou", "41": "t a quarter of a mile. I went out in the woods and cooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay there all night", "42": " when I hear a _plunketyplunk, plunketyplunk_, and says to myself, horses coming; and next I hear people\u2019s voices. I got everyth", "43": "ing into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went creeping through the woods to see what I could find out. I hadn\u2019t got far ", "44": "when I hear a man say: \u201cWe better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is about beat out. Let\u2019s look around.\u201d I did", "45": "n\u2019t wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy. I tied up in the old place, and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe. I didn\u2019t sl", "46": "eep much. I couldn\u2019t, somehow, for thinking. And every time I waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck. So the sleep didn\u2019", "47": "t do me no good. Byandby I says to myself, I can\u2019t live this way; I\u2019m agoing to find out who it is that\u2019s here on the island wit", "48": "h me; I\u2019ll find it out or bust. Well, I felt better right off. So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, a", "49": "nd then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows. The moon was shining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as l", "50": "ight as day. I poked along well on to an hour, everything still as rocks and sound asleep. Well, by this time I was most down to", "51": " the foot of the island. A little ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good as saying the night was about done. I ", "52": "give her a turn with the paddle and brung her nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edge of the woods. I", "53": " sat down there on a log, and looked out through the leaves. I see the moon go off watch, and the darkness begin to blanket the ", "54": "river. But in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetops, and knowed the day was coming. So I took my gun and slipped ", "55": "off towards where I had run across that camp fire, stopping every minute or two to listen. But I hadn\u2019t no luck somehow; I could", "56": "n\u2019t seem to find the place. But byandby, sure enough, I catched a glimpse of fire away through the trees. I went for it, cautiou", "57": "s and slow. Byandby I was close enough to have a look, and there laid a man on the ground. It most give me the fantods. He had a", "58": " blanket around his head, and his head was nearly in the fire. I set there behind a clump of bushes, in about six foot of him, a", "59": "nd kept my eyes on him steady.

And, besides,", "30": " he said them little birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want the things to get wet? So we went back and got the cano", "31": "e, and paddled up abreast the cavern, and lugged all the traps up there. Then we hunted up a place close by to hide the canoe in", "32": ", amongst the thick willows. We took some fish off of the lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner. The door ", "33": "of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit, and was flat a", "34": "nd a good place to build a fire on. So we built it there and cooked dinner. We spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat ", "35": "our dinner in there. We put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern. Pretty soon it darkened up, and begun to thund", "36": "er and lighten; so the birds was right about it.

Well, on every old brokendown tree you could see rabb", "53": "its and snakes and such things; and when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame, on account of being hungr", "54": "y, that you could paddle right up and put your hand on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and turtles\u2014they would slide of", "55": "f in the water.

We got an old tin lantern, and a butcherknife without any hand", "11": "le, and a brannew Barlow knife worth two bits in any store, and a lot of tallow candles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and", "12": " a tin cup, and a ratty old bedquilt off the bed, and a reticule with needles and pins and beeswax and buttons and thread and al", "13": "l such truck in it, and a hatchet and some nails, and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some monstrous hooks on it, a", "14": "nd a roll of buckskin, and a leather dogcollar, and a horseshoe, and some vials of medicine that didn\u2019t have no label on them; a", "15": "nd just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good currycomb, and Jim he found a ratty old fiddlebow, and a wooden leg. The stra", "16": "ps was broke off of it, but, barring that, it was a good enough leg, though it was too long for me and not long enough for Jim, ", "17": "and we couldn\u2019t find the other one, though we hunted all around. And so, take it all around, we made a good haul. When we was re", "18": "ady to shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it was pretty broad day; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe a", "19": "nd cover up with the quilt, because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good ways off. I paddled over to the Illino", "20": "is shore, and drifted down most a half a mile doing it. I crept up the dead water under the bank, and hadn\u2019t no accidents and di", "21": "dn\u2019t see nobody. We got home all safe. CHAPTER X. After breakfast I wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he come ", "22": "to be killed, but Jim didn\u2019t want to. He said it would fetch bad luck; and besides, he said, he might come and ha\u2019nt us; he said", "23": " a man that warn\u2019t buried was more likely to go aha\u2019nting around than one that was planted and comfortable. That sounded pretty ", "24": "reasonable, so I didn\u2019t say no more; but I couldn\u2019t keep from studying over it and wishing I knowed who shot the man, and what t", "25": "hey done it for. We rummaged the clothes we\u2019d got, and found eight dollars in silver sewed up in the lining of an old blanket ov", "26": "ercoat. Jim said he reckoned the people in that house stole the coat, because if they\u2019d a knowed the money was there they wouldn", "27": "\u2019t a left it. I said I reckoned they killed him, too; but Jim didn\u2019t want to talk about that. I says: \u201cNow you think it\u2019s bad lu", "28": "ck; but what did you say when I fetched in the snakeskin that I found on the top of the ridge day before yesterday? You said it ", "29": "was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snakeskin with my hands. Well, here\u2019s your bad luck! We\u2019ve raked in all this truc", "30": "k and eight dollars besides. I wish we could have some bad luck like this every day, Jim.\u201d \u201cNever you mind, honey, never you min", "31": "d. Don\u2019t you git too peart. It\u2019s acomin\u2019. Mind I tell you, it\u2019s acomin\u2019.\u201d It did come, too. It was a Tuesday that we had that ta", "32": "lk. Well, after dinner Friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of the ridge, and got out of tobacco. I went to", "33": " the cavern to get some, and found a rattlesnake in there. I killed him, and curled him up on the foot of Jim\u2019s blanket, ever so", "34": " natural, thinking there\u2019d be some fun when Jim found him there. Well, by night I forgot all about the snake, and when Jim flung", "35": " himself down on the blanket while I struck a light the snake\u2019s mate was there, and bit him. He jumped up yelling, and the first", "36": " thing the light showed was the varmint curled up and ready for another spring. I laid him out in a second with a stick, and Jim", "37": " grabbed pap\u2019s whiskyjug and begun to pour it down. He was barefooted, and the snake bit him right on the heel. That all comes o", "38": "f my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it. ", "39": "Jim told me to chop off the snake\u2019s head and throw it away, and then skin the body and roast a piece of it. I done it, and he ea", "40": "t it and said it would help cure him. He made me take off the rattles and tie them around his wrist, too. He said that that woul", "41": "d help. Then I slid out quiet and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for I warn\u2019t going to let Jim find out it wa", "42": "s all my fault, not if I could help it. Jim sucked and sucked at the jug, and now and then he got out of his head and pitched ar", "43": "ound and yelled; but every time he come to himself he went to sucking at the jug again. His foot swelled up pretty big, and so d", "44": "id his leg; but byandby the drunk begun to come, and so I judged he was all right; but I\u2019d druther been bit with a snake than pa", "45": "p\u2019s whisky. Jim was laid up for four days and nights. Then the swelling was all gone and he was around again. I made up my mind ", "46": "I wouldn\u2019t ever take aholt of a snakeskin again with my hands, now that I see what had come of it. Jim said he reckoned I would ", "47": "believe him next time. And he said that handling a snakeskin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn\u2019t got to the end of it y", "48": "et. He said he druther see the new moon over his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snakeskin in his hand.", "49": " Well, I was getting to feel that way myself, though I\u2019ve always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder i", "50": "s one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do. Old Hank Bunker done it once, and bragged about it; and in less th", "51": "an two years he got drunk and fell off of the shottower, and spread himself out so that he was just a kind of a layer, as you ma", "52": "y say; and they slid him edgeways between two barn doors for a coffin, and buried him so, so they say, but I didn\u2019t see it. Pap ", "53": "told me. But anyway it all come of looking at the moon that way, like a fool. Well, the days went along, and the river went down", "54": " between its banks again; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it an", "55": "d catch a catfish that was as big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two hundred pounds. We couldn\u2019t han", "56": "dle him, of course; he would a flung us into Illinois. We just set there and watched him rip and tear around till he drownded. W", "57": "e found a brass button in his stomach and a round ball, and lots of rubbage. We split the ball open with the hatchet, and there ", "58": "was a spool in it. Jim said he\u2019d had it there a long time, to coat it over so and make a ball of it. It was as big a fish as was", "59": " ever catched in the Mississippi, I reckon. Jim said he hadn\u2019t ever seen a bigger one. He would a been worth a good deal over at", "60": " the village. They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the markethouse there; everybody buys some of him; his meat\u2019s ", "61": "as white as snow and makes a good fry. Next morning I said it was getting slow and dull, and I wanted to get a stirring up some ", "62": "way. I said I reckoned I would slip over the river and find out what was going on. Jim liked that notion; but he said I must go ", "63": "in the dark and look sharp. Then he studied it over and said, couldn\u2019t I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl", "64": "? That was a good notion, too. So we shortened up one of the calico gowns, and I turned up my trouserlegs to my knees and got in"}, "177": {"1": "to it. Jim hitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit. I put on the sunbonnet and tied it under my chin, and then f", "2": "or a body to look in and see my face was like looking down a joint of stovepipe. Jim said nobody would know me, even in the dayt", "3": "ime, hardly. I practiced around all day to get the hang of the things, and byandby I could do pretty well in them, only Jim said", "4": " I didn\u2019t walk like a girl; and he said I must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britchespocket. I took notice, and done bett", "5": "er. I started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just after dark. I started across to the town from a little below the ferryland", "6": "ing, and the drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town. I tied up and started along the bank. There was a lig", "7": "ht burning in a little shanty that hadn\u2019t been lived in for a long time, and I wondered who had took up quarters there. I slippe", "8": "d up and peeped in at the window. There was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by a candle that was on a pine table.", "9": " I didn\u2019t know her face; she was a stranger, for you couldn\u2019t start a face in that town that I didn\u2019t know. Now this was lucky, ", "10": "because I was weakening; I was getting afraid I had come; people might know my voice and find me out. But if this woman had been", "11": " in such a little town two days she could tell me all I wanted to know; so I knocked at the door, and made up my mind I wouldn\u2019t", "12": " forget I was a girl. CHAPTER XI. \u201cCome in,\u201d says the woman, and I did. She says: \u201cTake a cheer.\u201d I done it. She looked me all o", "13": "ver with her little shiny eyes, and says: \u201cWhat might your name be?\u201d \u201cSarah Williams.\u201d \u201cWhere \u2019bouts do you live?

Col.

His f", "41": "orehead was high, and his hair was black and straight and hung to his shoulders.

He carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it. There warn\u2019t", "44": " no frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn\u2019t ever loud. He was as kind as he could be\u2014you could feel that, you know, an", "45": "d so you had confidence. Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when he straightened himself up like a libertypole, an", "46": "d the lightning begun to flicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first, and find out what the matter was", "47": " afterwards. He didn\u2019t ever have to tell anybody to mind their manners\u2014everybody was always goodmannered where he was. Everybody", "48": " loved to have him around, too; he was sunshine most always\u2014I mean he made it seem like good weather. When he turned into a clou", "49": "dbank it was awful dark for half a minute, and that was enough; there wouldn\u2019t nothing go wrong again for a week. When him and t", "50": "he old lady come down in the morning all the family got up out of their chairs and give them goodday, and didn\u2019t set down again ", "51": "till they had set down. Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard where the decanter was, and mixed a glass of bitters and handed i", "52": "t to him, and he held it in his hand and waited till Tom\u2019s and Bob\u2019s was mixed, and then they bowed and said, \u201cOur duty to you, ", "53": "sir, and madam;\u201d and _they_ bowed the least bit in the world and said thank you, and so they drank, all three, and Bob and Tom p", "54": "oured a spoonful of water on the sugar and the mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers, and give it to me", "55": " and Buck, and we drank to the old people too.

Each person had their own nigger to wait on them\u2014Buck too. My nigger had a monstrous easy time, because I warn\u2019t used to", "61": " having anybody do anything for me, but Buck\u2019s was on the jump most of the time. This was all there was of the family now, but t", "62": "here used to be more\u2014three sons; they got killed; and Emmeline that died.

There was another clan of aristocracy around there\u2014five or six families\u2014mostly of the name of Shepherdson. They was as", "3": " hightoned and well born and rich and grand as the tribe of Grangerfords. The Shepherdsons and Grangerfords used the same steamb", "4": "oat landing, which was about two mile above our house; so sometimes when I went up there with a lot of our folks I used to see a", "5": " lot of the Shepherdsons there on their fine horses. One day Buck and me was away out in the woods hunting, and heard a horse co", "6": "ming. We was crossing the road. Buck says: \u201cQuick!

Pretty soon a splendid young man come galloping down the road, setting his horse easy and looking like a soldier. He had ", "8": "his gun across his pommel. I had seen him before. It was young Harney Shepherdson. I heard Buck\u2019s gun go off at my ear, and Harn", "9": "ey\u2019s hat tumbled off from his head.

I tucked the moneybag in under the lid, just down beyond where his han", "2": "ds was crossed, which made me creep, they was so cold, and then I run back across the room and in behind the door. The person co", "3": "ming was Mary Jane. She went to the coffin, very soft, and kneeled down and looked in; then she put up her handkerchief, and I s", "4": "ee she begun to cry, though I couldn\u2019t hear her, and her back was to me. I slid out, and as I passed the diningroom I thought I\u2019", "5": "d make sure them watchers hadn\u2019t seen me; so I looked through the crack, and everything was all right.

I don\u2019", "13": "t wish to be mixed up in no such business as that, I says to myself. When I got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut u", "14": "p, and the watchers was gone. There warn\u2019t nobody around but the family and the widow Bartley and our tribe. I watched their fac", "15": "es to see if anything had been happening, but I couldn\u2019t tell. Towards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man, a", "16": "nd they set the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs, and then set all our chairs in rows, and borrowed more f", "17": "rom the neighbors till the hall and the parlor and the diningroom was full.

Then the people begun to flock in, and the beats and the girls took seats in", "19": " the front row at the head of the coffin, and for a half an hour the people filed around slow, in single rank, and looked down a", "20": "t the dead man\u2019s face a minute, and some dropped in a tear, and it was all very still and solemn, only the girls and the beats h", "21": "olding handkerchiefs to their eyes and keeping their heads bent, and sobbing a little. There warn\u2019t no other sound but the scrap", "22": "ing of the feet on the floor and blowing noses\u2014because people always blows them more at a funeral than they do at other places e", "23": "xcept church. When the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his black gloves with his softy soothering ways, p", "24": "utting on the last touches, and getting people and things all shipshape and comfortable, and making no more sound than a cat. He", "25": " never spoke; he moved people around, he squeezed in late ones, he opened up passageways, and done it with nods, and signs with ", "26": "his hands. Then he took his place over against the wall. He was the softest, glidingest, stealthiest man I ever see; and there w", "27": "arn\u2019t no more smile to him than there is to a ham. They had borrowed a melodeum\u2014a sick one; and when everything was ready a youn", "28": "g woman set down and worked it, and it was pretty skreeky and colicky, and everybody joined in and sung, and Peter was the only ", "29": "one that had a good thing, according to my notion. Then the Reverend Hobson opened up, slow and solemn, and begun to talk; and s", "30": "traight off the most outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard; it was only one dog, but he made a most powerful", "31": " racket, and he kept it up right along; the parson he had to stand there, over the coffin, and wait\u2014you couldn\u2019t hear yourself t", "32": "hink. It was right down awkward, and nobody didn\u2019t seem to know what to do. But pretty soon they see that longlegged undertaker ", "33": "make a sign to the preacher as much as to say, \u201cDon\u2019t you worry\u2014just depend on me.\u201d Then he stooped down and begun to glide alon", "34": "g the wall, just his shoulders showing over the people\u2019s heads. So he glided along, and the powwow and racket getting more and m", "35": "ore outrageous all the time; and at last, when he had gone around two sides of the room, he disappears down cellar. Then in abou", "36": "t two seconds we heard a whack, and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or two, and then everything was dead still, ", "37": "and the parson begun his solemn talk where he left off. In a minute or two here comes this undertaker\u2019s back and shoulders glidi", "38": "ng along the wall again; and so he glided and glided around three sides of the room, and then rose up, and shaded his mouth with", "39": " his hands, and stretched his neck out towards the preacher, over the people\u2019s heads, and says, in a kind of a coarse whisper, \u201c", "40": "_He had a rat!_\u201d Then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to his place. You could see it was a great satisfaction to", "41": " the people, because naturally they wanted to know. A little thing like that don\u2019t cost nothing, and it\u2019s just the little things", "42": " that makes a man to be looked up to and liked. There warn\u2019t no more popular man in town than what that undertaker was. Well, th", "43": "e funeral sermon was very good, but pison long and tiresome; and then the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbag", "44": "e, and at last the job was through, and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the coffin with his screwdriver. I was in a sweat th", "45": "en, and watched him pretty keen. But he never meddled at all; just slid the lid along as soft as mush, and screwed it down tight", "46": " and fast. So there I was! I didn\u2019t know whether the money was in there or not. So, says I, s\u2019pose somebody has hogged that bag ", "47": "on the sly?\u2014now how do _I_ know whether to write to Mary Jane or not?

Blame it, I says, I might get hunted up and jailed; I\u2019d better lay low and keep dark, and not write at all; the", "49": " thing\u2019s awful mixed now; trying to better it, I\u2019ve worsened it a hundred times, and I wish to goodness I\u2019d just let it alone, d", "50": "ad fetch the whole business!

And he said of co", "55": "urse him and William would take the girls home with them; and that pleased everybody too, because then the girls would be well f", "56": "ixed and amongst their own relations; and it pleased the girls, too\u2014tickled them so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in", "57": " the world; and told him to sell out as quick as he wanted to, they would be ready.
